__label__1 imagine a 2000 car or a 100 laptop or a 70 iphone or imagine any product ten times cheaper than it was imagine the fundamental market change that would bring imagine the amount of demand that would be for that two thousand dollar car or 100 laptop or 70 iphone thats what elon musk imagined 15 years ago when he sat on a pile of a hundred and sixty five million dollars elon musks businesses are all centered around some of the most basic principles of economics out there when he starts a business hes not necessarily trying to do something new hes trying to do something right musk made most of his early fortune through his involvement with paypal in 1999 he founded a company called xcom which was quickly bought bike infiniti the creators of paypal so when paypal was bought by ebay in 2002 musks 117 ownership of the company translated to a hundred and sixtyfive million dollars elon musk has always been deeply passionate about space exploration and as anyone knows public interest in space has been falling since the apollo era therefore musks plan with his newfound fortune was to launch a rocket to mars carrying a small greenhouse that would grow plants on the surface of the red planet basically he wanted to take all his money and put it into a big publicity stunt for space exploration but he had a problem it was too expensive the cost of launches was absolutely immense and even when musk tried to buy decommissioned russian icbms he couldnt find a way to pull off the project but he had discovered something the space launch industry was a ripe for disruption heres joseph the economics expert from reallife lore to explain why the rocket development and space launch companies before spacex were essentially aggregators they bought engines and guidance systems and all the other various components from other companies to cobble together one completed rocket but all the different component suppliers also had their own component suppliers to make their product the suppliers of the suppliers not only had to cover their development and manufacturing costs they had to sell their components at a markup in order to make a profit and then the next component manufacturer had to do the same which means that by the time the component gets to the company thats assembling the rockets its expensive not only that but the assembly company also has to pay for employees that work to actually figure out how to make all of the different pieces work together spacex however works differently it makes 85 percent of the components it uses itself which allows it to make cheaper parts for example if spacex had bought their radios externally they would be paying fifty thousand to one hundred thousand dollars each but since they developed them internally they only cost five thousand dollars each to build a dramatic improvement in reducing cost josephs firm reallife floor has a brand new book which includes two fantastic chapters explaining simple economic concepts like this thatll linked in the description but lets talk tesla teslas economic strategy is fairly similar to spacexs tesla themselves makes about 80 of the 5300 parts in a tesla car but for the most part it doesnt make these the batteries at least yet batteries are very difficult to make at a competitive price so very few companies do the largest three manufacturers panasonic byd and lg chem make a combined 63 percent of the worlds batteries tesla therefore has historically just bought batteries from panasonic at a cost of about 200 per kilowatt hour but that means that teslas smallest battery pack the 50 kilowatt hour version costs 10000 just in components when youre trying to sell a 35000 car and make a profit thats a significant cost that can be reduced therefore tesla is attempting to reduce the cost of their batteries by 30 by building their own factory in a joint venture with panasonic their longterm goal however is to drop the battery price below 100 per kilowatt hour which would either double the range or have the price of that 50 kilowatt hour battery pack but the vertical integration of tesla and spacex isnt all useful the companies basically have to learn and perfect each step in the manufacturing process and if one step isnt working no cars get made for example the tesla model 3 the lowcost tesla is built using steel instead of aluminum like the model s and x with this change the manufacturer is having troubles properly welding the vehicle bodies together and so the entire production line is slowed down massively but theres something else unique about spacex and teslas production lines theyre in the us now this probably seems counterintuitive why would you put the production lines of two companies working to make the least expensive products on the market in one of the most expensive labor markets in the world almost every us company has relocated their production lines to cheaper labor markets in asia and africa but musk has always had his in the us believe it or not this isnt a pr move it actually makes sense for the two companies tesla and spacex is production processes are constantly being tweaked and optimized as the companies learn to make their products while china might be able to build tesla cars at the same price by using cheaper human labor teslas us factory is just miles away from its headquarters in palo alto meaning that the executive development and production staff are all heavily integrated and can make changes fast spacex even takes this a step further its offices and manufacturing lines are all under one roof the tesla factory in particular is also heavily automatized and the us excels in production line automation with its abundance of highly skilled workers but just how much is musk dropping the price on his products the united launch alliance which historically has won most of the highly lucrative us government launch contracts is believed to charge more than 400 million dollars all in for a military satellite launch while spacex charges about 80 million dollars so spacex is already out of fifth of the price but as mentioned elon musk wants set to fall to a tenth heres the key for that the fuel used in the falcon 9 rocket only costs about 200000 per launch its practically a non factor in the launch price the real cost is of the rockets themselves so thats why spacex is making them reusable the first stage of the rocket is now being designed to land back on earth and be put back into service with dozens of more launches once this system becomes reliable its believed that the cost savings will drop the launch price to 40 million dollars a full 10 times cheaper than the united launch alliance is military launch price spacex is longterm goal is to get the launch price down to about 10 million dollars per launch while the company has already made a significant impact on the space industry a launch price as low as this would fundamentally change whats possible in space real space tourism would become feasible commercial satellites would become downright commonplace and space would become closer than its ever been but spacex does have a bit of a problem people arent really buying more rocket launches even though prices are down its whats known as a price inelastic market thats the opposite of tesla and the electric vehicle market where lower prices lead to huge increases in sales the problem with the space launch market is that it is not a consumer market normal people dont buy rocket launches governments buy rocket launches and they dont care about price nearly as much as people since its not the decision makers money the us air force for example decides they need to launch a certain number of satellites each year for national security reasons and theyll pay whatever it takes but elon musks life goal is to get humanity to mars thats why spacex exists and he needs money to do it lots of money so spacex is getting into the internet business the company is actively developing a satellite constellation that would provide highspeed internet to anywhere on earth thousands of small satellites would be put into lowearth orbit and then anyone a worldwide could hook into the network using an inexpensive ground receiver if spacex got just 50 million users out of the seven billion in its proposed service area this business could bring in 30 billion dollars a year since spacex would be building and launching the satellites themselves costs would be dramatically lower than the competitions the whole commercial aspect of spacex essentially exists too fun musks future space exploration projects for that reason spacex is not a public company like tesla elon musk does not want to make money with spacex he wants to get to mars he does not want to be beholden to shareholders and profitability musk has therefore publicly said that spacex will not go public until the company achieves regular flights to and from mars and thanks the entrepreneurs understanding of basic economics that might not be too far off if youre looking to start a company youll need not only understanding of basic

__label__1 so at some point during your life youve probably experienced something that you would describe as unlikely but what are some of the most unlikely things that could happen to you during your life to start with something more easy to visualize imagine walking into a room with 30 random people there is a 1 in 12 chance that you would share the same birthday with somebody else in that room which seems unlikely but its almost infinitely more likely than some other future probabilities later in this video if you apply to harvard you only have a 1 in 20 chance of getting accepted but thats still more likely than taking a pair of dice and rolling a snake eyes which is only a 1 in 36 chance to get a little more unlikely you have only about a 1 in 100 chance of developing a brain tumor during your life and a 1 in 102 chance of getting killed in an automobile accident if you live in the us medically speaking you had a 1 in 500 chance of being born with 11 fingers or toes which is still more likely than a high school hockey player ever going pro which is only 1 in 500 98 in fact its very unlikely that any random high school athlete will ever make it to the pros with baseball being one in 659 football at 1 in 4233 soccer at 1 in 5000 768 and most challenging of all is basketball at 1 in 11770 one two throw some more numbers in there to see how unlikely these statistics really are the odds of you correctly guessing a fourdigit pin code are one in a thousand and the odds of you bowling a perfect 300 point game are one in 11500 but all of these are more likely than you getting struck by lightning which you have a 1 in 12000 lifetime chance of happening to you in the us if your skills at golfer average then you have a roughly one in 12500 chance of hitting a holeinone at the golf course which is still much more likely than you getting murdered in us which you only have a one in eighteen thousand chance of per year were starting to get into the pretty unlikely events now so with that being said you only have a 1 in 54000 chance of dying from a bee sting the odds of you dating a supermodel are unfortunately only one in 88000 and the odds of you becoming the ceo of a fortune 500 company are based on what degree you hold mbas have a 1 in 135000 chance engineers have a 1 in 164000 chance and lawyers have only a 1 in 386 thousand chance which is less likely than you getting killed in a firework accident at 1 in 340 thousand the next time youre playing poker you should know that the odds of you being dealt a royal flush are just one in 649 thousand seven hundred and forty which is only slightly more probable than their risk of the asteroid 2017 yz1 impacting earth on june 30th 2014 which is a 1 in 670000 chance lets fast forward ahead to the very unlikely events that probably wont ever happen to you or anybody else that you know the odds of you getting killed by a terrorist in the us are just 1 in 4 million and the risk of you getting eaten by a shark are even lower at just 1 in 8 million you have a kind of surprising 1 in 10000000 chance of becoming the president of the united states if youre a us citizen which is even more likely than you dying in a commercial plane crash at the very very low odds of only 1 in 11 million but we can keep going to even more ludicrously unlikely events like your risk of getting killed by an asteroid impact at just one in 74 million eight hundred seventeen thousand so youre literally more likely to get hit by an asteroid and die than you are to win the jackpot of the powerball lottery where the odds are a staggering 1 in 175 million back in 2016 the powerball jackpot reached 16 billion dollars and you stood a better chance of winning that than you ever would have at winning the comparatively small one grand prize of the mcdonalds monopoly game at just one in 451 million but even still there are people that these statistically unlikely events actually have happened to but the next events are so unlikely that they may never happen to anybody in history like picking a perfect ncaa bracket at a chance of just one in 128 billion nasa claims that the odds of you getting killed by a falling satellite are just 1 in 21 trillion and if you havent studied for that test coming up in a few days you should know that the odds of you passing a 100 question multiple choice exam by guessing on every question are only 1 in 750 trillion but the most unlikely thing that ill be talking about in this video that could happen to you seems pretty mundane at first shuffling the same deck of 52 cards and getting the same order of cards twice the odds of you doing this are roughly 1 in 80 in big antillean or one in eight point zero 6 5 8 times 10 to the 67th power or an eighth with 67 zeros written in front of it there are more ways to arrange a deck of cards than there are atoms on earth which means that every time youve shuffled a deck its very likely that exact order of cards has never before been seen in human history and likely never will be again but the best way that anybody has ever described this in my opinion was a user called leofric on a reddit thread that ive linked in the description his quote roughly reads as follows eight point zero 6 5 8 times 10 to the 67th is such an enormous number imagine that you set a timer for that many seconds stand on the equator and take a step forward every 1 billion years when youve circled the entire earth once take a drop of water out of the pacific ocean and repeat when the pacific ocean is empty lay a sheet of paper down refill the pacific and repeat when your stack of paper reaches the sun look at your timer it seems to have barely changed you started with eight point zero six five eight times ten to the sixty seven seconds and now you still have eight point zero six three times ten to the 57 seconds still remaining to kill the time further you start doing something else shuffle a deck of cards and deal yourself five cards every billion years each time you get a royal flush buy yourself a lottery tickets each time that ticket hits a jackpot throw a grain of sand into the grand canyon when the grand canyon is full take one ounce of rock from mount everest empty the grand canyon and start the process all over again when everest has been completely removed from the map check the timer again theres still barely any change its now at five point three six four times ten to the sixty seven seconds remaining you would have to repeat this entire enormous process 256 times to run out the timer to zero the reason this is so complicated is because of a mathematical principle called factorials you can figure out how many combinations at deck of 52 cards can be arranged into by multiplying 52 by 51 by 50 by 49 and so on until you get down to one thats how you get a number as ridiculous as this so the math that goes into figuring out something like this is one of the most confusing things that ive ever experienced in making videos for this channel but knowing probability can be extremely rewarding the next time you go to a casino for example it would be good for you to know that playing blackjack is where youre most likely to win any kind of money and your starting hand determines what you should do based on probability if your hand starts with 12 you only have a 31 chance of busting on the next card but if you start with a 20 your ought to shoot up to 92 percent and you can see everything else in between i learned all of this and more by taking the course on games of chance over at brilliant org and you can quickly do the same numbers and math dont come easy to me naturally and they never have and im sure many of you probably struggle with the same issue but brilliant can help a lot with making you feel more confident rather than simply telling you numbers and facts about games like blackjack or poker and hoping you memorise them they start by teaching you the intuitive ideas behind the probability that influences what happens by playing through their puzzles youll come to understand how games of chance actually work

__label__1 you only need to drop your phone off a boat or into a puddle or yes into a toilet once to wish for a world where all smartphones are waterproof well the good news these days a lot of them are but at least waterresistant the bad news theyre probably not as resistant as you think im mr mobile and today were gonna learn how to decode ip ratings to find out how much water your gadgets can really handle and were gonna talk to the grand marshal of all gear destroyers himself mr jerry rigged everything to learn how water wrecks your gadgets and what you can do about it if it does long story short out im sorry thats your line zack long story short its best to keep your electronics as dry as possible but yeah thanks for have me on mr mobile lets do this yes lets okay so if your electronic gadget claims that its waterresistant odds are it carries an ip rating and that is one of the most misunderstood things in mobile the ip stands for international protection and its a huge body of standards covering everything from power outlets in your home to streetlights but basically its all about keeping harmful stuff from the outside out of the insides of your product in 2018 most phones that are advertised as waterresistant carry an ingress protection rating of ip67 or ip68 you notice how i set each number individually instead of 67 68 well thats because each digit means something different the first number has nothing to do with water at all this is all about keeping solids out in this case a six means the phone is so well sealed that not even dust can get in thats important to protect the components and also to keep things like camera lenses free of dust if you see a number lower than six here its not dust tight so youll want to take care not to store it in areas with a lot of sawdust err find particulates well like i imagine zacks workshop is but in fact even with that protection earpiece speakers are magnets attracting metal that rips waterresistant speakers to shreds so accidents can still happen i cant decide if that fact is fun or scary anyway if you see an x in either part of the rating that doesnt necessarily mean its unprotected but it does probably mean it wasnt tested for that category the second number of the ip rating is where the waterproofing comes in the scale goes from dripping water to spraying water to fiercely spraying water to a total dunk and then various depths of a dunk and what that boils down to is if we look at a phone with a seven rating at the end well that should be able to survive while submerged under one meter of water for up to 30 minutes that doesnt mean itll start leaking at 31 minutes it just means thats how long the test goes for now a phone with an eight at the end of its ip rating should be able to survive in up to three meters of water but the exact time and depth of the test can vary according the manufacturer the deeper you go the more pressure there is on the device and the bigger chance that water will get inside and do damage thats right now as with all numbers the ip code can be confusing first off the water rating is not cumulative what that means is that a device with an eight at the end of the ip rating is not necessarily also certified for the same stuff that have five or six s see those ratings use powerful jets to blast water at the phone from every direction which is a very different kind of stress than just dunking the unit under water if a phone is rated for both spray and immersion youll see both of those called out on the spec sheet separately like sony does with its xz2 smartphone but no matter how well you know the code there are still lots of reasons you should keep your phone away from water for that zach take it away teach us something thanks man first thing to keep in mind is that all of these ip tests assume that its fresh water salt from the ocean or chlorine from the pool can cause nearinstant corrosion youll notice that after scuba divers get out of the salty ocean theyll rinse off their gear with fresh water so that salty corrosion doesnt have a chance to set in also lets say your phone is about a year old and its been dropped a few times experienced temperature fluctuations all of which can compromise the adhesive and the ip rating over time also even if the phone does have an ip rating almost no manufacturer will warranty water damage you might ask how do these companies know that the phone has been wet before well theres these little white stickers attached to the motherboard that turned pink when wet ive shown them a few times on my channel and theyre inside every smartphone finally youve probably seen the youtube videos that dunk a not waterproof phone in the sink for a few hours and then pulled out and its still working even though its working it suddenly does not get honorary waterproof status corrosion is probably already happening inside of that phone it just might not show up instantly water damage is an inevitable cancer over time it will kill the phone so like i said before its better just to keep your phone dry as much as possible and only rely on that ip rating for accidents thanks a lot man and i can testify to that last point see i used an lg v 30 to film an afternoon of snorkeling in the pacific followed by tomfoolery in the pool and though i carefully rinsed it with fresh water its display flickered out mere minutes after i got out of the pool when my producer justus pried open that sucker using tools we borrowed from you zack we found the culprit a tiny and i do mean tiny salt deposit on a pinkie nail sized component right here where water probably snuck in through the speaker membrane im not dumb salty about this i shouldnt have been swimming in the ocean with this phone and i know that but in this era where a lot of phones are advertised as waterresistant or even waterproof well i wanted to share the cautionary tale with you so youll know not to make the same mistake that

__label__1 no one knows when theyll reach the end of the road and what kind of death they may be faced with it could happen in an instant without warning or it could be a long dragged out process leaving a person with plenty of time to reflect on their life samuel butler an english author who lived in the 1800s once said if life must not be taken too seriously then so neither must death this quote brings us aptly to todays topic about an end that may be one of the better ways to exit the world welcome to this episode of the infographics show death by laughing a friend tells you a joke and you laugh then they tell you a really funny joke and you laughed so hard you fall over and then theres the funniest joke of all the one that made you laugh yourself to death this is of course just a figure of speech i mean if you had really died laughing you wouldnt be able to tell people about it as youd be lying six feet under in a wooden box but can you really die from laughing actually if you laugh hard enough then it is possible to kill yourself it can happen due to stress on the body when in hysterical laughter some of the ways include ruptured brain aneurysm collapsed lung leading to suffocation heart attack strangulated hernia which cuts off blood flow to vital organs its fixie ation seizure or stroke none of those circumstances sound very funny at all so what about some real cases ones where people have found themselves on the wrong side of the joke when we started a research online we were surprised to find there were more than we had expected weve looked at some of the more interesting cases to see what was discovered about the cause of death beyond the joke that got these people laughing in the first place lets take a look v sisyphus was an ancient greek philosopher a huge man he lived more than 200 years before christ and was known for his work in stoicism an ancient school of philosophy of personal ethics this meant sisyphus valued the qualities of his mind over everyday sensory pleasures which made the story of his death somewhat comical in itself as it involved plenty of alcohol beverages and a random donkey it was at the 143rd olympia where the drink would have been flowing there are two accounts of the story in the first sisyphus was a legless on strong whine and keeled over from laughter or was it too much wine the second story is a bit more dramatic having seen a donkey chomping on figs sisyphus decided that give the creature some wine to wash the fruit down he found the incident so hilarious that he laughed himself to his grave its hard to properly verify such an old story but its certainly an interesting one for next we have the odd case of dem no insane whom a 52 year old ice cream truck driver from bangkok in thailand who died while laughing in his sleep yes you heard me right in his sleep thailand newspaper the nation reported that same whom laughed for about two minutes before stopping breathing his wife tried to wake him up but he continued to laugh the autopsy suggested that a heart attack might have been the final cause of death ive never seen a case like this but its possible that a person could have a heart seizure while laughing or crying too hard in their sleep said dr somchai chakra bond deputy director of the mental health department three thomas tommy frederick cooper lived from 1921 to 1984 he was a british comedian and magician who wore a red fez which is a red cylindrical hat with a tassel named after the moroccan city of fez cooper was a big man standing at six feet four inches and weighing more than 210 pounds on the 15th of april 1984 this british comedian collapsed with a heart attack on live national television it may not have been technically the laughing that killed cooper but he was cracking jokes at the time and surrounded by laughter as he was on stage in the midst of a comedy routine at her majestys theatre in london the live audience and thousands of tv viewers thought it was part of his act its so waited for him to get up but it was soon clear that something was wrong  two more recent times in 2013 22 yearold mangesh bogle visited a multiplex along with his girlfriend in the state of versailles in india to watch a hindi comedy called grand masti everyone loves a comedy but mccall loved it so much that he laughed himself all the way to a heart attack boo gall was rushed to cardinal gracias hospital but died before the ambulance could get him to the emergency room rakesh shah director of kt vision explained that during the incident i was at the box office when one of our employees informed me about the incident the youth was with his girlfriend and they were watching the 6 pm show of grand masti those who sat beside the youth said he was laughing his heart out according to indian newspaper dna a police official from manik pure police station said that a case of accidental death has been registered one and finally theres the case of uk citizen alex mitchell who suffered heart failure after viewing the ecchi thump episode of the goodies in 1975 maybe youve not heard of the goodies theyre all made up of three british comedians tim brooketaylor graeme garden and bill oddie who wrote and performed comedy shows during the 1970s and early 1980s and funny enough to cause heart failure it seems but this mystery further unfolded in 2012 when mitchells 23 year old granddaughter lisa cork had a near fatal heart attack at home on the isle of sheppey in the uk she was diagnosed with long qt syndrome which doctors believe also could have caused mitchells death there are just a few cases of how some people have laughed themselves to death the ones we looked at stretched to thousand plus years one thing that seems certain is that its not actually the laughing and joking that causes someones life to end but instead an underlying medical condition though if youre fit and healthy its probably safe to keep laughing hard at your favorite jokes do you know of other strange and unlikely ways people have kicked the proverbial bucket let us know in the comments also be sure to check out our other video what happens when you die

__label__1 whales have always fascinated me theyre the largest creatures that we know of in the entire universe at this moment and the blue whale in particular is the largest organism that has ever existed bigger than any dinosaur or any other creature that weve ever known about their heart alone weighs as much as an average toyota corolla while their heartbeats can be heard from over two miles away their tongue weighs as much as an elephant and altogether they can weigh up to 200 tonnes they truly are one of natures most majestic creatures but like all the rest of life on earth they will eventually die and when they do it can create some significant problems most often when a whale of this size dies their bodies will sink below to the bottom of the ocean where well enter a new phase of life after death the carcass becomes a bountiful source of food for sharks and fish that can last for decades and the bones become a home for all types of different marine life in death a whales body will provide life for countless other species and become in a way the worlds largest organ donor but in some other instances the death of a whale is far less glamorous sometimes their carcass will float to the oceans surface where by means of the wind and currents it will be carried away to a beach somewhere and left there since thousands of whales die every year inevitably some will end up washing up on a random beach and sometimes whales will beach themselves intentionally or accidentally while theyre even still alive every year up to 2000 marine animals will probably beach themselves alive around the worlds coastlines one particularly terrible instance happened on the morning of the 10th of february 2017 when researchers discovered that 416 pilot whales managed to beach themselves on the coast of the south island of new zealand the following morning another 240 pilot whales beached themselves in the same area for no clear reason bringing the total number up to 656 many of them were rescued and drugged back out to the sea but over 300 didnt make it and left behind their bodies on the beach which presented an interesting logistical problem when it came to to remove all of them pilot whales are big but theyre not really gigantic so they can generally just be drugged back out to the sea or cut into smaller pieces to be disposed of but bigger whales like the sperm whale are a bit more challenging to deal with not only because of their sheer size and weight but also because they have a bad tendency to sometimes explode which is the reason that dead whales can be so dangerous this happens because after a whale dies gases will begin to build up inside of the carcass as its interior organs begin to decompose but since whales have really thick skin in an even tougher layer of blubber beneath that the builtup gases are difficult to be released causing the whale carcass to appear bloated heat on the beach surface and the whales own enormous body weight crushing itself on the land contributes to orifices closing up which makes this problem even worse generally when this happens now marine biologists know to approach the carcass with a sharp sickle or a knife at the end of a pulp that theyll use to make an incision across the whales belly to allow some of the builtup gas to escape safely but even still this can still sometimes result in the whale partially blowing up anyway like in this viral video from the faroe islands back just a few years ago poking or disturbing the whale carcass in an unscientific manner can cause the whale to rupture even more spectacularly though which is why you shouldnt really mess with one if you ever happen to see one a case in point of what can go wrong with a dead whale can be observed by an incident that happened in taiwan back in 2004 a pretty big whale washed up on a beach here and over 50 workers were called up to help and remove it they used three cranes and took over 13 hours just to load the carcass onto the back of a truck once it was in place the plan was to drive it from the beach through the city of tainan into a wildlife reservation area where university students could study it up close the transportation initially went off without a hitch but the whale suddenly ruptured while on the back of the truck splattering blood and chunky whale guts across the surrounding shops cars and unlucky people who probably had one of the worst days of their lives but an even weirder incident happened in the us back in 1970 a whale carcass washed up on a beach in oregon and being in america the local government decided that blowing it up with half a ton of dynamite was the best way to get rid of it the idea was that it would blow the whale apart into smaller pieces that could then be eaten up by scavengers like seagulls but thats not exactly what happened the explosion sent huge chunks of whale blubber flying through the sky that smashed cars hit peoples homes and littered peoples yards most of the whale chunks were too big for any scavengers to scoop up while most of the whale carcass itself still remained intact sitting on the beach forcing the cleanup crew to manually remove it themselves over the next few weeks by hand and with construction excavators so built up gas is what causes whales to sometimes explode but built up gas underground from decomposing plants can also cause hills to sometimes explode too to see how that happens

__label__1 whats it like to work at linus media group well i think its great ive seen my names on the building yeah how that feels locking up in like yeah my name is on the building but if you want the real answer youll probably have to ask the poor schmucks who do the actual grunt work around here so we made a deal they said if you agree not to watch the video we will give the viewers the real honest answer and i kind of went okay music the be quiet pure bass 600 features a versatile design noise insulation and optimization for different liquid cooled radiator configurations learn more at the link below i remember thinking this guy is so quirky psychotic petite hyperactive insanity yeah somewhat like insane slightly insane like how much insane i mean were not were not dead in the water yet so i got their 501 no answer and my first thoughts are holy crap this guy is so intent that im a minute late for my interview he walks up shot leaves doesnt even consider me hes coming at you with all this energy and all this drive and you just kind of have to match that like has no semblance of personal time and is more than willing to like spend every hour of his life working  as a leader i think has always been specifically good at inspiring drastic action and he transforms that once youre already here to inspire gratuitous amounts of overtime that may or may not be linus had this idea to make videos about building computers to level that no one else had ever tried to make so this is our first build guide it took us like 18 hours close down the retention arm a little bit of strength required here i think we finished at like 4 am i have never regretted anything more than taking the job at lattice media group for the first two weeks and after that things got a lot better we had so much work to do linus is very decisive but he was very vague in his decisiveness he doesnt really know how youre going to do something just what youre going to do when linus tells you that something will be done in two hours i always double the amount of time in i had and more often than not i am correct quite a bit of fun to work for in like a constantly disorganized and a bit wacky kind of way so ive never used a reciprocating saw and its plugged in i had kind of weird manta  like i said not working with my much i get demands i can paint my face can you find this can you that so thats a leader i think its very random and interesting so i never heard one of my bosses like fart audibly from across the office before but if youre wondering at any point if were actually as unorganized and incompetent as we seem on camera its its actually like that were not faking that and actually  for a mistake i mean everything about  was a mistake but this in particular filling was last i was a mistake he had like the genki of setup and as i walk away the test bench fell and probably the scariest nilla my life  comes back everythings on the floor we lost the footage of something that had been shot earlier where linus was installing something his attic lives was definitely yelling and swearing like ive broke him some stuff accident before and he was mad but thats like really short you know short bursts of anger its very rare where youre freaking out and im not i only freaked out when its really really bad whenever hes like no no its okay and then he walked through eight what thats the gps antenna yes oh music okay everything is fine everything is fine and i am calm and once he gets to a certain boiling point you can just you can feel it the kind of mad where he gets really highpitched and does i was doing the land dock and i messed up one of the topics and he came upstairs and he just said youre fired and i didnt know if he was joking or not so i just continued working and everything went fine and then about a week later i accidentally copyright strike tower channel and then linus said youre fired and i thought that time maybe he was serious because you know i looked down the whole channel singlehandedly ive had some terrible terrible bosses sometimes you know ive been able to get one either like a boss who knew what they were doing or like a boss who like cares about people but getting both of those together has been a new experience hes really professional like an efficient like he doesnt like to waste time nothing is not willing to do things entirely the wrong way for the sake of finishing this video right now after 30 minutes of me sitting out front of the door just waiting for somebody to like answer the door he calls me and he goes oh i completely forgot about her interview in lines like this questions is stupid this ones dumb i dont want to ask this one and they puts it puts down the paper and goes all right are you into bestiality do you watch bestiality i was like the 25th person to get interviewed a lot of time he got to me and i was last i think he had a real shred regimen of what he wanted to get through and he probably didnt have any time or energy to waste on any bullsh excuse me hes like yeah you heard me im like ah no and hes like ah just messing with you he found my twitter and read all of my tweets ask me why tweeted that what that meant who i follow i follow them so that was a little bit aside for me it was fine but a little bit strange the first interaction i had with linus actually on the phone was my first interview it was at an indian restaurant with his children it was kind of like a first date but someone brought along a baby the whole thing was full of really bad jokes so a lot of nervous laugh and stuff like that yeah it was like an interview but i didnt know it was an interview i was just literally there to have lunch with him one of the things that i actually liked about the relationship that lion i have is i can no filter and he can no filter and everyones fine when were done when i started he didnt really know what he was doing i didnt really know what i was doing and we both kind of grew into figuring that out under this stupid thing and then undo this others do a ridiculous thing they are using im sure theres stuff that comes up that catches him offguard or whatever but he seems to be pretty on top of everything at all times very well prepared for everything that comes up i hate when hes right he hates when im right what were both often right about the things that were respectively working on and that balance is fun and also frustrating im pretty sure ive only probably talked to him oneonone for maybe about i want to say 15 minutes been here for two years because hes just so busy just back and forth its kind of like hide and seek i always need to find him on the car ride to or from somewhere is when we can actually talk about whatever so thats when you actually get to know him as a person whereas when were all at work theres really time for nothing else but working certainly years i kind of saw linus as like the crazy maniac and i was just trying to help them do whatever it was trying to achieve but recently because ive taken on managerial roles hes more of a teacher than before and i dont want to turn into him but id like to to steal some of his skills its a lot more structured here than i think a lot of people would assume compared to the beginning things are a lot more corporate it seems like were a lot less mobile or agile to just change directions theres intense meetings then theres deep statistical analysis all this kind of stuff which doesnt make it feel as like fun its actually really refreshing to have a working relationship with somebody whos well the ceo of the company but you know were working together side by side he understands the value of spending good money on employees and equipment so thats the product that we make which is videos in this case is good a hundred and thirtyeight thousand us dollars for two red cameras and the bulls accessories that they make you buy 60000 in hard drives to store all this crap on another 20000 in nvme ssd so that all of our editors can edit red footage off of arnavs at the same time you know he cares you know he cares about all of us that work here he cares about you guys watching and hes just hes just a loving father i dont know i mean he said hes not going to watch it i suppose everyone knows i was gonna watch this and then hes going to come around be like so heard you think i say its final retirement of that i always felt that a leader should ride a horse and ive never seen him on horseback so i guess if i were going to say one thing that linus could do to improve himself as a leader in my eyes is id like to see him on a horse more it would make me feel a lot more at ease music

__label__1 if what you want in your next smartphone is something a little different well 2017 is going to be a really good year for you on the flagship side this year lg is leading the principal charge for an android alternative to samsung but it discarded last years compromises and gimmicks for a return to the fundamentals a renewed focus on quality and a camera im dearly going to miss when i have to move on im mr mobile and this is the lg g 6 review brought to you by mid sim music the g6 has the best hand feel of any lg phone of use the chromed out plastic and strange paint jobs of previous models have been replaced by glass and aluminum construction that gleams like metal in a platinum version and gives the black trim a liquid allure thats gorgeous as long as you keep a chamois handy harkening back to 2012 optimus g the g6 feels heavier than it actually is and lgs refusal to taper the edges makes it seem thicker too this is a welcome change of pace the result is a phone thats easy to hold and reassuringly tanklike and backing up that hand feel is ip68 dust and water resistance as well as protection against temperature extremes and mechanical shock none of this is to say that you should go around smacking your phone into parking lot puddles and the gorilla glass 5 backplate does indeed get scratched in such situations but it should handle abuse better than its immediate predecessor of course if you want a real beast theres the allmetal v20 but the g series is made to appeal to a broader audience and the g6 does a great job of feeling both accessible and exceptional that also applies to the screen its 57 inches but well so is this one ill give you one guess as to which is easier to use onehanded the two to one aspect ratio means you can symmetrically stack two apps at a time or watch fancy new shows in the hip 18 by 9 format at press time netflix and google play movies each allow true fullscreen scaling on the g6 but youtube does not so youre still going to get letterboxing or pillarboxing with some video for me the more exciting bit is the ergonomic win because of the stretched screen the phone can display more while staying easy to use and lg has a couple nice software tricks to make that onehanded use even easier the screen is hd are ready and when its not being used you have the option of a persistent clock or signature and notifications will show up here too that said if you use that ambient display the backlight will be working at least a little bit all the time that might account for some of the middling battery life ive seen from my g6 i can usually make it through the day but sometimes its a stretch unless i periodically top it up oh hey look wireless charging is back hooray the early software im using could be responsible for some of that power drain  this is android 70 when the g6 comes to the us itll offer 71 and no doubt some polishing of the lg ui but even in its current state its less obtrusive and more responsive than any lg skin that come before i installed nova launcher after a week just to spiff up the look and feel and the g6 runs it well despite a spec sheet some are calling disappointing well come to that in a second though because first i really i just have to show you the cameras if you follow the mr mobile on the instagram or facebook you already know how enamored i am of this array which uses one camera for standard pics and one for wideangle shots what does this mean for you no more backing up to get everyone in the frame no more holding your phone above your head to cram in all your lunch draw these photo pairs youre seeing i took both pictures from the same exact position often ill shoot with the wide lens even when i dont need it just for that added dramatic effect now there are disadvantages to going wide all the time as with most of these lenses you get a pronounced fisheye effect that distorts the edges also theres no optical stabilization on the wide side as there is with the standard lens and the aperture is smaller as well which means its not as good for night shots and the frontfacing camera gets so grainy and dim settings as to be pretty distracting but lowlight is still a challenge for most smartphones anyone remember my first nighttime walkabout with the pixel and really its all a balancing act isnt it the question is does the g6 camera bring enough capability to forgive its shortcomings and the answer for me is an unqualified yes of all the things ill miss when i move on from the g6 the camera tops the list music for all that the g6 gets right it doesnt check all the boxes for some power users for them a 2016 processor in a 2017 flagship is anathema while two generation old gorilla glass on the front and a lackluster single edge speaker scream costcutting adding insult to injury this is the first g series flagship since 2013 with a non removable battery and while phone calls are handled with lgs usual aplomb audio files will be unhappy to learn that the premium dac shipping an overseas models wont come to us shores whether these shortcomings are worth dwelling on will depend on your priorities and of course what the us pricing turns out to be no word on that yet from lg but even if that price scrapes the stratosphere the g6 has a lot going for it during my two weeks with it i never thought oh i wish i had a snapdragon 835 because the 820 one is more than capable of handling anything i can imagine wanting to run on my phone for the next year i also never said i wish this camera was better because it does stuff no other smartphone camera can do about the only thing that gives me pause is the software situation lg is not so great at keeping up with android update but then again you can say the same of many manufacturers so for me the g6 hits a lot more than it misses im comfortable recommending it to anyone looking for a compelling alternative to samsung and the highend or a smart phone camera unlike any other

like favorite lot of life it does and then the silver ones too like if thats all solid thats quite a bit of money and then so welcome to scrapyard wars you guys might be wondering whats up with all the mad stacks will this scrapyard wars is gonna be a little bit different we are going to build a computer we are gonna build a good value computer but there is no set budget the challenge today with our special guest austin evans is to build the best bang for the buck computer will be using five different benchmarks tomb raider far cry 4 sentiment pc mark and 3d mark fire strike to determine who has gotten the most possible value for their money music all right friends care package from debrand d brand skin ah yes sirs so we got an s6 edge we got a note 5 and weve got yes my friends macbook airs pearl okay so these are the tools that well be using to do all of our scrapyard waring thanks to thee brand lets see i think my macbook air is supposed to be like a special one so orange yes i believe that one is that one is it so you guys can flip over the other two because i am totally going for this is a new orange finish from them that looks absolutely sickle that i gotta say i like the wood grain that orange is pretty i was mad at my wood grain if i got wood grain on the laptop sure id always want me okay so out of all you guys but i got my d brand phone i got my chest strap done up oh you got the real stuff right yeah you got the real stuff right yeah me too bro so lets go noholdsbarred scrapyard wars holds board hes gross wait i should i need my laptop where does my laptop go here it is okay really happy lets go dude uh have you got here okay alright basically my plan right now is oh there we go okay totally thought the door was locked all right so the plan right now is to just get out of here so i think it looks way more legit if were like not here so were going its a great question uhuh lets not be here lets just drive a little ways and figure this out so okay potential problem number one i actually havent even done any pre thought ive been so busy that i havent had any time to figure out how im gonna tackle this challenge potential problem number two theres three of us this time theres gonna be craigslist crap thats listed two weeks ago that they get no calls about and im gonna have three people calling them today so we it is gonna be a race against the clock to win scrapyard wars three which obviously means its a great idea that im sitting here on a couch i should i should really get going its gonna try to save some money by avoiding a case build everything to make a cardboard box or something its all about price to performance so if i spend like even half the budget i almost feel like were gonna go over because i know im thinking like six seven hundred dollars something like that you know of a cool spot around here like i know my hotels over here whats a cool spot like we could hang out so nowhere oh that is some wicked gas were not in the car yet though so its okay oh man oh wow thats like that is some outdoor grade gas one of my biggest concerns is that i think were gonna be fighting for parts i think were gonna be fighting for parts because i dont think theres actually that many for sale right now im wondering if it has something to do with the canadian dollar being in the tank at the moment its my tip so one of our dastardly plans is to send responses from craigslist ad posters to those guys that they never actually messaged so well try and well try and get them off the trail get them confused so were all gonna be on craigslist were all gonna be trying to find the same deals or maybe not because the way that i see it theres actually a few different ways to tackle this we can try and get the cheapest possible computer that is at least capable of running the benchmarks and hope the other guys spend way more or we can go for like the traditional bang for the buck pc somewhere in the seven to eleven hundred dollar range and win the benchmarks and hope the other guys arent able to get great value for the dollar i frankly dont know what the answer is right now yeah what if we try to do like a hundred dollar gaming pc build i dont know if its necessarily going to be awesome but its price to performance right so if this is as tenth as good as if they spend 1000 then we actually win so this could work its only ten dollars and its even here this could work maybe okay so i just got a two hundred and twenty dollar offer on a box of video cards oh were calling this guy were calling this guy that looks like an 8600 gt s like if we can just taking up space on a shelf if we can get that for like two bucks or five bucks or something we might be in pretty good shape its an option so im calling the guy with our 9280 430 bucks im gonna offer him our twenty can you do 120 bucks awesome when do you want me to come pick it up yeah yeah but port moody is like a city like i need to know where okay so i got a r9 280 for 120 bucks i really want to get that 290 but i dont think the price per performance is worth it when the 290 would be over 100 or no basically exactly 100 more i dont know theres theres some funny math there because you have to calculate it in the whole rest of the system as well but i think its you eighties gonna be good and i think i need to move on to other things so ill go with that if im learning anything from this is that people like to really over price their old pc hardware like people like trying oh my my sixyearold gaming pcs worth 800 it was worth 1200 five years ago no dude its worth like 300 ollars get over yourself maybe in the used market in general is just because that turnover is so low yeah dude yeah i mean im just seeing tons of junk here and everyone so i see something cool like okay so this is a g4 7900 for 50 i mean its got svideo on it its not gonna be worth 50 i dont care what you say wow a lot of this stuff is pretty brutal is that a 9600 for 10 bucks though thats not bad lets save that in the numbers sheet the best thing to do this is gonna be a disadvantage for austin in this whole competition because he hasnt done this before but the best thing to do is write in the first couple hours put out as many feelers as possible yeah youre right this does take a long time i also totally want to find like i got pawn shop not it all right oh thats a good idea thats a great idea yeah i like the car just like runs out theres a queue 9650 cpu im still potentially interested in that if i can get it for the right price i think were gonna need a quadcore to win that cinebench is gonna make a big difference i wonder how austins doing at this point like new city like he doesnt even know where any of these sub regions are like hes gonna be like oh yaletown thats probably pretty close okay i think we might have found something here a pair of 7950 graphics cards for 150 and thats both of them so basically one of them actually they were both used for bitcoin mining but i dont really care as long as it works for long enough where i can actually like benchmark that could work 150 wheres this 13th avenue is that burnaby what was that anywhere near burnaby newest did any idea where that is scrapyard wars well be right back after these messages this episode of scrapyard wars is brought to you by deep brand makers of the precision cut vinyl skins that youll see on the phones and notebooks of our contestants they offer a wide variety of styles and colors and support for the coolest devices including the playstation 4 galaxy note 5 and iphone 6s protect the body of your devices and make them look great at be brandcom slash scrapyard wars trying to work on the system so what im trying to find now i have a graphics card im really not gonna look for a case power so im probably gonna have to get on its own and so what im looking for right now is a motherboard processor memory essentially and a hard drive i guess but i might try to sneak an ssd in there if i can i just dont know if itll be worth it because most of our benchmarks are cpu and gpu 60 for an ssd that could be that could be all right maybe i think you might be able to get a new ssd it would probably wouldnt be that its find out that much cheaper but we also maybe try to get that guy down a little bit so this guy wants 60 bucks for a 120 gig ssd that is so not happening 60 ferb price you can buy brand new 240 gigs for 98 so ill see if i can get him to be a little bit more realistic yeah i was just wondering if you were interested in selling parts of it at all yeah its a pretty good point i was only interested in the motherboard processor ram and potentially power supply i call him up im like are you interested in selling just the parts and hes like oh yeah totally that was my first idea when i was gonna be on craigslist was i was just gonna part it out and he ends the phone call like well im okay with selling the parts if you buy all of them so so far ive got a graphics card that im picking up a hat to read something that was a r9 280 for a hundred and twenty bucks i dont know if thats like necessarily the best deal i could get but i wanted to move on to system because i did notice that a lot of my processors theyre kind of scarce right now i cant find very many of them so i had a whole graphics card options im just like okay i just want to get that out of the way i should have maybe done that later but whatever im really trying to find my platform right now having a little bit of trouble with it dude i think this might be it 150 for 279 50s thats gonna kill it all right this is this is we totally need to go this way so now lets try to find some other parts and start calling thats totally way to go dude thats thats it thats that those are our cards right there so for a lot of the components im just gonna be kind of browsing whats out there and buying whatever but for the graphics card i think i have to shop a little bit smarter so im gonna be using on in text bench repository in order to compare graphics cards across the generations and then from looking at it briefly im feeling pretty good about the approach of going with a tahiti based card so either a 280 or 280 x or a 79 50 or 70 970 i think thats where were gonna get the best bang for our buck so im gonna lowball this to 80 x and kind of go from there okay so this is how i write a craigslist email hows it going sorry youre listing for the pair of 79 50s i plan on building a gaming pc and was wondering if youve made sure they can gain i dont plan on mining but want to make sure both cards are fully working thanks cuz ive got to be polite im in canada so fire that off and hopefully we hear back okay im just being like a little bitch hi im contacting you about the 280 extra sale are you firm on the price i dont think i can spend that much whenever someone contacts you like that are they open with that well not like a loser but like getting a better price makes you a winner yo but uh in a little bitch hey heres a good deal on an ssd lets see if this guy has a phone number 40 bucks call all right im gonna offer im gonna offer 30 for a 120 gig if i can get it im feeling really good about my storage drive who uses a home phone number i cant even text that so im gonna im gonna just im gonna play every game in the book sisty on craigslist i can come get it today if you can do 30 do you have anything else for sale im trying to build a budget gaming pc for a friend of mine whos moving away maybe next time itll be like my six sister or something she broke her arm and she cant go out much so were getting her gaming computer look you might be judging me here but i have a competition to win so yeah i did say noholdsbarred this is the guy with the lots of older computer stuff come he says come take a look should we just should we just go check it out okay ive come across an interesting discovery theres a 7950 gx  thats a dual gpu card the guys asking 25 bucks if i can get that for like 10 or something i could be in a really good shape no thats a directx 9 part okay i knew i knew when we were choosing the benchmarks that we should have gone with something older than far cry 4 but it looks like you have to run it on dx 10 or dx11 hardware so right now ive switched from buying that that r9 280 to an arnai 200 or 290 i havent told the 280 guy yet because the 290 guys seems a little bit flaky so im think im gonna wait until i get a actual confirm from him so the next problem we have is just having to power these 279 50s so i started looking around there are not a lot of power supplies we might be able to find something used but just out of curiosity i looked on ncix its gonna be like 97 dollars to get like a corsair zx 750 we might have happen to buy some new stuff because the options on craigslist or not is as solid as i was hoping and plus there are a lot of people think that stuff is worth way more than actually is so were super stressed on time right now so much so that were having delicious sushi because you know we got this okay so i found something decent here so this guy has an older computer but hes willing to part it out so you get a cool master case with a db right 20 bucks and theres a power supply a 500 watt power supply for 30 bucks that can work but i dont think thats something 950 is claiming to power though what if we get to really keep power supplies oh and like tape one in the top or something yeah cool so like we basically just tell you how like one 500 watt power spike in the system like with like tape another one to the top just to power the other graphics card i almost want to do that purely because of how ridiculous it would be it might not even save us any money that would be awesome now were gonna go try to hit up some local computer stores maybe try to find like some used cases we still need like a motherboard and memory okay so i didnt realize theres gonna be an apple specialist i mean were here we might as well try yo you have a mac right okay so slight change of plans we just left the macbook at the restaurant no big deal but uh that was my bad so lets uh take it back to the air before uh this macbook gets stolen i cant believe i just walked off bets neither of us saw that right next time on scrapyard wars

__label__1 music 19 simple psychological tricks that actually work there are all kinds of fancy books on neuro linguistic programming and psychology that can help professionals get what they want from others but there are also much simpler yet just as effective methods that anyone can use on a daily basis here are 19 of them 1 never start your request with the words could you it can cause the other person to subconsciously assume that this is a theoretical question for example avoid questions like could you call the neighbors because the answer yes can mean yes i fear reticle e good but i didnt agree to it sure good is polite but its better to rephrase your request to please call the neighbors if you want to be sure that itll be fulfilled  if you ever want to make someone feel uncomfortable look at the middle of their forehead during the conversation most people say it makes them feel like theyre under scrutiny which of course doesnt exactly make a person relaxed not sure why youd want to do this to others but who knows the situation may arise 3 if someone youre talking to is trying to avoid answering a question just make a pause in the conversation while still keeping eye contact theyll feel uncomfortable and thus will keep talking chances are theyll give you more details about the issue youre interested in they may even start telling you the truth if they were lying since theyll believe that your silence and your look are signs that you already know the real facts for lets say youve started a new job or school if you want someone in the office or class to like you just ask them to explain something to you it doesnt matter if you know the answer or not this will improve the other persons overall attitude towards you and earn you some extra brownie points 5 when asking a question that you want an affirmative answer to try to nod subtly as you make your request this trick is often used by restaurant employees to make by more food and its pretty effective sex if a person is really concentrated on a task lets say theyre in middle of a serious phone conversation you can extend your hand to them and get anything theyre holding at the moment they might not even remember later on the trick works the other way around too you can give them something as youre talking to them and they wont even notice pretty helpful when youre cleaning up or moving to a new house 7 if you want somebody to do something for you casually say how they probably wouldnt even be able to do it most people will try really hard to prove someone wrong when it comes to doubting their capabilities you can also make a small or unusual request before getting down to the main issue in this case youll establish a connection with a person so they probably wont have the heart to turn you down afterwards 8 just like with questions you need to get an affirmative answer to start nodding just a little bit during a conversation interestingly enough this will make the person youre talking to more attentive to your words and they wont even realize why 9 heres a good one for negotiations if you like a persons offer in general but would like to get better conditions prepare to be a little bit disappointed this method can work like magic with a high price or a low salary 10 as soon as your alarm clock goes off sit up make two fists and yell yeah as if youre a soccer player whos just scored a goal it sounds bizarre but it really does help you easily get out of bed feeling refreshed just try it for yourself and let us know down in the comments if it worked for you 11 if youre always worried whether or not you lock the door or turns your iron off just say some absolutely absurd phrase when youre doing these things the phrase could be different every single day for example you say green rabbit and turn the iron off or oppressive crab and lock the door the next time you start doubting whether or not you did something youll remember saying this weird phrase and itll calm you down so well if a person tries to pull you into an argument or some kind of drama say something nice to them youll kill them with kindness trick really does stop them in their tracks another technique is to keep your calm and remain silent theres nothing more irritating than being ignored however if youre trying to avoid an argument with your friend or partner try to put yourself in their shoes this can help you understand if theres some point in their objections that you are missing 13 if you have that one lazy person on your team that slows the whole work process down dont give them tasks by saying do this its better to say start with this psychologically itll seem like theres less work because according to this phrase they should start with something small after theyve done the first task use the words very good now continue with this until they end up finishing what you wanted them to do in the first place 14 if you have to speak in public dont forget to take a bottle of water with you first of all youll need it since your nurse will make your mouth feel like the sahara desert plus you can take a pause to sip some water in order to remember a part of your speech that slipped your mind the audience will never know and if you feel too anxious to speak in front of a large crowd admit this fact to the audience right away it lightens the mood calmes your nerves and it makes your listeners feel more sympathetic since most of them can probably relate 15 if someone is staring at you in the subway happens all too often right just look at their shoes dont give up keep gazing itll drive them crazy 16 if you seem really worried each time you see someone you know in the end this person will also start feeling worried every time they see you so do with that information what you will 17 if someone has done something wrong but you dont want to sound to accusing change the way you construct your sentences for example instead of saying you didnt close a window before you left you can say the window was left open all night theyll learn from their mistake and you wont seem like a meanie pointing the finger 18 if you didnt get a good nights sleep tell yourself that you did i know it sounds like nonsense but it does work 100 if you say it with meaning scientists from colorado college published a study in the journal of experimental psychology in which they found that if you genuinely believe that youre wellrested even if youre not your brain does function better nineteen people are better at remembering what happened at the beginning and end of the day as for anything that went on in between it gets blurry this is a great tip when it comes to job interviews agree to a time thats either at the start of the work day or at the end of it this way the employer will remember you among all the other candidates do you know any other effective tricks that can help you get what you

__label__1 now you might look at this somewhat eclectic pile of hardware and go what a piece of junk but for me everything on this table holds a very special place in my heart because what youre looking at is after hours of scouring ebay free geek craigslist basically  a piece my first gaming rig so if you were building a gaming machine on a budget back when i was in high school amd was a very compelling option the chips were cheaper the boards were cheaper and this was actually the deciding factor for me thanks to a collaboration with nvidia which is probably a hard thing for our younger viewers to imagine given what bitter enemies theyve become since amds acquisition of ati back in 2006 they had much better onboard graphics than you could get on an intel chipset and so i decided on my weapon of choice the sol tech sl 75 m rn l the crappier onboard graphics version of the famous fr nl  fr n2l whose budget overclocking prowess was second only to their amazing sense of style that is until sol tech went out of business only a few short years later thanks to their use of shoddy electrolytic capacitors that pretty much all leaked just outside of the warranty period i mean actually its a miracle i found a working one of these i could have substituted some other board with geforce 4 mx graphics onboard but to preserve the integrity of the build i way overpaid some jackass who runs an ebay store who thought this thing was worth over 100 because i tweeted i was looking for one so his listing got a bunch of hits oh next up is my cpu the legendary athlon xp 2500 plus amd marketed this processor quite cleverly but branding was similar to microsofts then brand spanking new windows xp and used the pr model number system to compare the lower clocked but higher ipc athlon chips to intels gigahertz marketed pentium 4 family it ran a doublepumped 16 66 megahertz frontside bus effectively 333 megahertz and featured 512 kilobytes of cache with a clock speed of 18 3 gigahertz and was a well known excellent budget overclocker with an unlocked multiplier that allowed basically all of them to run at 3200 plus speeds or about 22 gigahertz k7 was notably the last gen of amd chips to use a frontside bus before they changed everything industrywide by moving the memory controller on board with the athlon 64 physically it looked very different from modern cpus the die was completely exposed with only some rubber pads around it to prevent it from chipping or cracking during heatsink installation you can see this one is quite chipped so yeah they didnt always work very well and the pin layout on the bottom is very retro looking socket a has 462 pins on the bottom laughable when you compare it to a modern apu that has over 900 pins in a much smaller area and a similar sized modern intel chip that uses lga type contact pads rather than pins to improve durability and pin density and squeezes over 2000 in about the same area more pins are used for additional signaling to the motherboard and other system components for these more advanced processors cooling and overclocking of mine 68 watt beast was taken care of by a very unique product this is the van tech aero flow one of the only cpu coolers at least on the desktop to feature a tip magnetic drive fan tmd fans have the benefit of being able to use more of their area for cooling because the center hub contains no motor only a bearing and the tips of the fan blades actually have magnets that are driven by coils in the frame of the fan cool huh less cool is the fact that they vibrate like crazy and theyre loud and on top of that because of amds mounting system in those days putting this thing on sucks so the cpu die isnt actually centered between these two fragile plastic mounting clip things so the heatsink needs a cutout on the one side for the the hinge for the retention arm on the socket and only goes on one way then you actually needed to like seriously this was the intended way to install the heatsink in those days put a screwdriver into this not on the other side and sweat bullets while heaving down on it to pull the latch over the clips and then move it slightly to lock on to them i mean there were so many omg i put my screwdriver through my motherboard posts on the forums in those days my ram choice was dictated by what was cheap at ncix at the time so this samsung 512 megabyte ddr 400 stick that i got from free week actually still has the ncix barcode sticker on it and is exactly what i used in fact it could be the exact stick that i had for all i know i opted for a single stick even though this platform is dual channel capable to give myself more room to increase the capacity of my rig in the future technically three fix could be run in dual channel on this platform with one stick twice the capacity of the other two but it was a kludge solution and not guaranteed to work the case and power supply is where i really have to take a moment to thank free geek the guys that we did this collab with for hooking me up even antec didnt have an original land boy buried in the catacombs and i could not find one of these they took those guys like two weeks to find one and set it aside for me thanks guys the original land boy before they sullied the name with this nonsense was the bomb it was made of aluminum very cool for the time it was affordable it included not just a power supply but and this was a huge deal especially then a decent 350 watt power supply with blue led lighting and while it may not have featured literally any room for cable management or even front panel audio it did have a removable three and a half inch drive cage for easy harddrive and floppy installation easy install sleds for the optical drive and a side panel window to show off the aftermarket 80 millimeter blue led fan that i bought on an impulse like two weeks later at london drugs officially my first way overpriced computer modding component for drives my original gaming rig reused the floppy drive and cd burner that i got as handmedowns from my uncles pentium machine this is not an insignificant part of the reason that front case doors were so fashionable at the time black drives were not that common and they were even more expensive than their beige counterparts yes friends the optical drive was as pricey as it was essential in those days for the hard drive though i couldnt carry forward an old one if i wanted better speed and to have enough storage to install more than one cd based game at a time so an 80 gig with an 8 meg can 20 gig with a 2 meg cache cost about the same i eventually settled for the 80 feeling confident that that was more than id need for a long time and feeling like the extra performance would be more worthwhile drives sure used to be more difficult to install by the way av pin vs 40 pin ide cables master and slave jumpers you kids have it easy for the rest of the machine im using close approximations of the components that i had at the time my crt was not a flat screen and yes young kids we called it a flat screen because the piece of glass in the front was flat rather than curved we knew it was still big and heavy and i actually had slightly different handmedown keyboard than mice before upgrading a year or so later to a wireless nx duo but the one thing that is exactly the same here is the mouse pad being too cheap to buy a real mouse pad i used a piece of paper to overcome the tracking issues on my computer desk and it worked great by the way you just have to replace it every once in a while so we interrupt the scripted portion of this video to bring you the moment of truth pressing the power button after of course turning on the power supply oh you hear that tip magnetic drive fan music come on display its alive a flaw an xp 11 gigahertz thats okay we can go and change that manually you can see 32 megs of memory shared hard drive not being picked up ill diagnose that later maybe that ide cable delete sander setup and there we are lets get some windows xp installed on this great so then with the system working the only question remaining was will it run minecraft and the answer is surprisingly no after overpaying for that stupid motherboard it turns out that the system is not stable enough to do anything more than install windows and look at the desktop not entirely unexpected but disappointing to be sure so if youre not familiar with math drop the concept is pretty simple theyve got this huge community of enthusiasts and i cant say like computer enthusiasts or knife enthusiasts or audio enthusiasts because theres all these different enthusiasts so maybe they simply go hey theres this like really cool product that wed like can you go to the manufacturer or an authorized reseller and tell them hey you know were all willing to buy it if you could yeah just do a little something on the price math drop takes buyers and sellers and does volume deals so everyone gets a good deal the manufacturer sells a bunch and the buyers get a lower price pretty freakin cool and you can check it out at the link in the video description but recently they have branched out a little bit and theyve started working with manufacturers to do special editions of their products just for mass drop and special pricing is of course included as well so they worked with hifi man this time around to bring back the aichi 300 with a special md or mass drop flare so in their former life solely under high and these entrylevel headphones were priced at about 300 us dollars and the new one is very similar to the old hg 300s but with an updated and more lightweight structure more neutral sound signature and an allblack appearance compared to the silver and black of older generations the most important change however that they have made is reducing the price to a very actually legitimately low 99 us dollars so all you got to do to check them out is head over to the draw dots l tt  ichi  350 dont expect you to remember that check it out at the link in the video description that youre done doing all that stuff youre probably wondering who gee what should i watch next so maybe uh maybe a review of like a super 6 17 inch gaming laptop you can check that one out there i guarantee you that it is both more powerful and smaller and more expensive and thats three things that it is both of than this

__label__1 lets just cut right to the chase there is this ladder in jerusalem and no matter whatyou will never be allowed to move it and nobody else probably will either i meanyou could move itnothing physically is preventing you from doing it the next time you are in jerusalem but legallyyou cantand if you did you might start a riot or a war why is that the casebecause of historyhuman nature and religion you seethe ladder rests on a ledge just under this window above the entrance to the church of the holy sepulchre in the old city of jerusalem the church building itselfis ancientdating back to the 4th century ad and it claims to house the two holiest sites in christianity both the location of jesus crucifixion and the tomb where he is said to have been buried and ressurected because of these claimsthe church of the holy sepulchre is revered by numerous christian denominations that have all placed a claim to property ownership of the building control of the church today is shared by 6 of these denominations and a fiendishly complicated and confusing agreement that has been placed out for at least 160 years they include the greek orthodoxarmenian apostolicroman catholic coptic orthodoxsyriac orthodox and ethiopian orthodox churches and their agreement to share the church goes back to 1757 back thenjerusalem was controlled by the ottomans and the sultan at the time issued a decree that permanetly preserved the ownership of the citys holy sites to their then current owners since the holy selpuchre was owned by many groups an understanding was established between themthat absolutely nothing in the church could be changed from the way it was when the agreement was signed without the approval of all 6 religious orders this agreement is still largely enforced today and has lead to things like everybody neglecting badly needed repairs or renovations to the church building because the 6 orders cant agree on what the outcome would look like but its also lead to things like the ladderwhich was already there on that ledge when the agreement was made and nobody can move anything without everyones approval first the agreement is taken so literally by the owners of the church that moving a piece of furniturelike the laddercan spark a fight between them like it did just in 2002 a coptic monk was sitting on a chairon the roof of the building protesting the ethiopian monks taking over the rooftop monastery the coptic monk moved the chair he was sitting injust slightly more to be in the shade but since the chair is considered to be jointly owned by all 6 religious orders and since he had moved it without approval from the other five it was quickly considered a violation of that 1757 agreement and started an all out fistfight between them where a dozen monks became injured a similar violent event happened again in 2008when the armenian monks where holding a ceremony and wouldnt allow a greek monk to participate with them the greeks protested by blocking the ceremonywhich sparked this huge fight that you are now seeing on screen the israeli riot police had to be called inside the church to break up the fight and two monks got themselves arrested there is plenty of other times that violence has errupted over seemingly minor disagreements here which is part of why nobody is allowed to move the ladder nobody even knows how exactly the ladder got there or when but most people assume that a mason was doing repairs around 300 yeas ago andyou knowjust kinda left it there the ladder is shown in an engraving of the churchback from 1728 it was mentioned in the ottoman sultans edict in 1757 in is present in this photograph from sometime in the 1850s so its been there a whilebut the problem is that nobody knows to which of the 6 christian denominations who share the church that person who left it therebelonged to because it could have been any denominationthe ladder is considered by many to be owned by all 6 and therefore requires the approval of all 6 to be moved which wont be happening any time soon pope paul vi in 1964 issued a pontifical order that the ladder was to permanently remain in place at the churchuntil the catholic and orthodox churches reached a state of unity that means thatfor nowthe catholics wont ever agree to moving it which means that nobody can legally move it for just that reason the ladder has become a symbol to many of the divisions inside the christian religion and despite being refered to as theimmovable ladderit has actually been moved a couple of times in 1981 a prankster tried to move itbut was quickly stopped by the israeli police and in 1997this guy just flat out stole the thing through the window and disappeared with it for a few weeks the ladders movement sparked tensions between the religious communties insideas would be expected and apparently the prankster felt pretty bad about it and returned it back to its original place the last time the ladder was moved was in 2009 and it was just a temporary move to clean up the area around it like i said in the beginningnothing is physically preventing you from moving the ladder the next time youre there but you probably shouldnt unless you wanna risk starting an incident or having a meeting with the police

__label__1 what do you do when youre building a smartwatch for a world that doesnt seem to care much about smartwatches if your samsung you cram in every feature you possibly can im michael fisher and this is the gear s3 the wristwatch that does it all if you watched my handson video from the summer youll know there are actually two versions of the gear s3 the classic and the frontier this is the latter a less lookey but better equipped version built for those who need to do more than they need to wow this one packs bluetooth wifi nfc gps and cellular radios and its ruggedized steel casing is framed by thick rubber wristbands all that makes for a beefy wearable and well its not as absurdly huge as the casio f10 its still substantially larger than most of the competition on my wrist the only thing that really screams big is the thickness its tough to get a shirt sleeve cuff over it and if i were to buy one id probably swap the wristband for one thats a little softer or id just buy the classic model instead but if i did that id miss out on one of the frontiers halo features the lte version doesnt need your smartphone to function that includes making and taking phone calls over the speakerphone it was tinny and a bit shrill on my end but callers on the other side said i sounded no worse than over a regular phone and if you want you can connect a headset to the gear s3 over a bluetooth take your calls that way now the watch does have its own phone number but att offers a feature called number sync that essentially spoofs your regular digits so you dont have to deal with the headache of two phone numbers and samsungs new software lets you do a few things right on the watch that you used to need your phone for like downloading new watch faces and apps the selection is kind of thin but there are some big titles here with more presumably on the way besides notifications the most utility i got out of the gear s3 was mobile payments by now youre used to seeing people paying for coffees with their apple watches and samsung pay offers the same type of technology but the gear s3 works even on oldfashioned credit card terminals the ones that only have a magnetic stripe reader you just press pay hold your wrist next to the card slot and the watch kicks out a magnetic field that emulates the strip on your debit card i used this at four or five different stores and had a smooth checkout every time even when i didnt have my phone on me its easily my favorite feature of the s3 the watch has more familiar equipment on board too i didnt find much use for the altimeter but the barometer warned me to pack my umbrella a few times when the mercury was crashing and the health centres are very smart the watch knows when youre say taking a walk and automatically starts tracking your movements and heart rate so it can log health data for you all that info is fed into the s health app which is fully featured and easy to use though obviously youre going to get more accurate metrics from a dedicated fitness band if you wear the gear s3 to bed it will also automatically track your sleep to paint a more complete picture of your health dont think youre going to be wearing it to bed too often though despite samsungs lofty claims of fourday battery life my typical experience was about two days between charges thats no surprise given how much tech is crammed into this package and also keep in mind im using the lte version like most smartwatches though youre probably going to want to throw the s3 on the charger every night on the upside that charger is magnetic its wireless and very convenient as a bedside clock the downside since the watch doesnt really play nice with other cheat chargers you need to remember to bring the cradle with you on every road trip in oddsandends this is an absolutely beautiful display and on it is samsungs best software yet you control it through the touchscreen the spinning bezel and the buttons on the sides it takes a couple days to settle into the flow but once you do its a lot of fun the watch face is in the center of the carousel notifications stack up to the left as they come in and widgets are to the right and when youre not actively using the watch the alwayson display is the best ive ever seen there are some shortcomings notifications sometimes take a beat or two to make it from phone to watch s voice is still a pretty lacking virtual assistant and there doesnt seem to be a quick way to assign a widget to things like the timer or stopwatch that seems minor i know but this is after all a watch for what youre paying it should be the best at the basics  and what youre paying for the gear s3 is 349 that goes for the bluetooth only editions if you get the lte version of the frontier youll be getting it from att or tmobile for a different set of prices and youll be paying a monthly service fee to make it work whether thats worth it to you will depend on how you feel about smartwatches for all its features the gear s3 isnt going to transform the category and i doubt itll convert those whove already written off the segment as a whole but two smartwatch appreciators looking for an android compatible alternative to the apple competition this is it and frankly i think its bolder than the apple watch in many respects i do agree with my colleagues at android central though for all the freedom the lte version affords its just too expensive when all said and done if you buy the gear s3 youll probably be better off with the bluetooth only version as long as you dont often stray from your phone and dont forget to shop last years shelves  for a similar experience in a smaller size the gear s2 is still on sale and its still a good buy at its much lower price there are plenty of other smartwatches resting on wrists the world over
__label__1 the comfort of the bose or the elegant style of
__label__1 time is something that none of us can escape from and all of us around the world live with different times and different schedules planning these times and schedules can get complicated when you board a plane or travel some other way between different time zones like when you fly between new york city and los angeles where you would have to adjust your clock back three hours upon arriving in la but some other trips around the world can get way more complicated than that thanks to how badly weve messed around with the global time zones in a perfect world our planet would be divided between 24 equal time zones each representing one hour of the day but we dont live in that world we live in a world where countries borders and politics exist that have horribly skewed this perfect ideal into something that looks more like this and here are the most extreme examples of the oddities you can find using this map lets start off with spain which despite being in the same general longitude as burton ireland and portugal remains one hour ahead of those countries this means that you can fly from london and travel west to madrid and still have to move your clock one hour ahead instead of backwards the reason thats the case is because francisco franco said so back in 1940 when he moved spains time ahead an hour to be closer to nazi germany and over 70 years later theyve still just decided to never change it back and speaking of countries that have made questionable decisions regarding their time zones china is probably the weirdest normally china is large enough to cover five different time zones in the ideal world but in reality the chinese government has decided that all of china is just simply one timezone that follows beijing time they did this in an attempt to create a sense of national unity across the country but its had the unintended consequence of messing with peoples lives in the western part imagine for a moment if the united states just declared that the time in washington dc was now the time across the entire us this is a pretty similar case and the people in the western parts of china are about two hours behind beijing in real terms this messes with workers productivity in the area and it means that if you have a normal 900 to 500 job you can either effectively go into work at 700 am and leave at 300 pm or you can adjust your schedule going to work at 11 am and work until 7 pm a few years ago apple randomly switched users time zones in this area to the unofficial time zones they were using to get by and caused many people to accidentally sleep in for two extra hours and as a final weird consequence of this policy you can walk across this very tiny border from china into afghanistan and have to set your clock back a full three and a half hours after crossing which is a bigger time difference than traveling all the way from boston to los angeles you can achieve by just walking a few minutes next up is how weird the international dateline looks in the pacific again in theory the international dateline would be a straight line with a 24 hour time difference on either side of it while the pacific here is mostly empty there are a few islands and land chunks that curve the line pretty dramatically in some places like here in samoa where the government decided to completely skip december 30th 2011 and move the country forward an entire day besides them not liking lebron and wanting to skip his birthday the other reason they decided to do that was because way back in 1892 the samoan king moved the country east of the dateline in order to be closer connected to the us but over a hundred years since then samoas economy grew closer to australia and new zealand instead despite being 21 hours ahead in time from sydney so in 2011 they changed it back to how things were before 1892 but this created another awkward situation in neighboring american samoa just 70 kilometers away which stuck with being east of the dateline which makes a 24 hour time difference between them and a 25 hour time difference in the summer but even weirder is this monstrosity and carabosse where the date line lunges out 2000 miles to surround it before coming back to relatively normal this situation means that you could start in hawaii on a monday travel south and end up in tuesday and if you kept going south youd end up back in monday this also means that at some point every day there exist three days going on at the same time in different parts of the world when its 630 am in new york on saturday its 1130 pm in american samoa on friday and its 1230 am in christmas island pure abbas on son day but perhaps the weirdest timezone change you can ever experience is right here in the united states the us is mostly pretty straightforward with four time zones that cover the continental 48 states and one each for hawaii and alaska but daylight savings time is where things get complicated two states dont follow daylight savings time which doesnt matter because its surrounded by ocean and arizona which is weird because its surrounded by land but arizona gets even more weird when you consider the borders of the navajo reservation which does follow daylight savings time this is even further complicated by the hopi reservation which is totally surrounded by the navajo reservation and like the rest of arizona decides to not follow daylight savings time but the navajo reservation has an enclave inside of the hopi reservation which creates a time zone map of arizona during daylight savings time that looks like this in theory you could drive in a straight line and hit all of these spots and have to change your clock an hour back and forth seven times all while driving inside of the same state and while road trips like this one can be a lot of fun

__label__1 while many of you build your own pcs weve shown before that buying from a system builder can be a good way to save yourself some hassle get extra warranty support on your machine and thanks to the economies of scale even save a buck or two but who exactly should you buy from well to answer this question properly we couldnt rely on cherrypick samples where the system builder knows who theyre shipping to you know some extra cable management here a touch of extra overclocking there so as we learned over the last couple of scrapyard wars you look like something i know  that means that i couldnt be involved in the process at all not even to get on the phone so we devised a plan we recruited agent janice from accounting equipped her with 1500 us dollars per system and gave her a simple mission as someone who doesnt know that much about gaming computers buy the best gaming pc you can following the advice of the pc advisers on the other end of the line and i think the results here are gonna shock you theyre certainly going to shock me because i havent heard any of this yet ivan you got the donuts and coffee because i think its time for me to have a good oldfashioned stakeout lets do it team groups geforce delta r gb ssd features a large luminous rgb body with readwrite speeds up to 560 megabytes a second check it out at their thang miss sale in the link below music all right so we decided to go with two different types of system integrators so a big well known manufacture solar and packard okay a niche picture yep then im envious already i see what you did there so then we went with the two highvolume manufacturers such as i before and sir okay and then finally we were antique yeah  boo dicks so we went with the origin and we went with main gear okay yeah i have a feeling were not gonna be making any friends over the next half an hour or so here hold your judgment like these people have never heard of a computer before its a gaming type of a computer you heard it here first what what no second yeah yeah for those who didnt know what is it three times if you just try it do you just write us a little up again holy fourth im poor thats the best like a tower i just learned it yeah so thats canadian dollars its he just like looking up gaming computers on dellcom hes been gone for 30 seconds yeah with no elevator hes back hes not even like hold on a second wheres they have up to nine years wheres he pulling these numbers from like that there is no way that that isnt out of the script you heard that here first its like 10 times faster than the other one like 10 times faster the other one great deals but hes passing her off to someone yep just a 461 multigpu approved with liquid cooling does not have to oh because the k doesnt come with a box heatsink but she doesnt leave that we pulling and that also isnt the power supply like what is he even talking about like oh you also get that was his job to tell her and he didnt until she called him out and the price discrepancy yeah you should say thanks for your time cuz she gave him an awful lot of it hi okay thats not bad a minute to reach a person okay so location purpose budget tells you right away there was a discount but we dont even know what the spec is like we dont even know if thats a good deal and then so if i had like about two hundred dollars to spend are there any upgrades or things i could do to make it like yeah he has all the thats a pretty good question like net monitors resolution yes oh but then he didnt follow up and like whats the resolution okay missed opportunity oh the warranty here no he has no idea how hard shes laughing lets see how many times that are i gather hows it wait what clearly doing it wrong what we still dont know what the specs of the system are they just said thats the link and they said this is good for gaming didnt specify theres alissa did he send her a link like is she looking at the system or know hes getting your email now so we still dont know what system were bad but he already found her solution that says is depress the best specs for gaming and has a deal on it and hell feet within 2 grand lets see what he sends so thats a gamble because if he gets it wrong he looks like an idiot and if he gets it right then we just had a really streamlined experience thats what it comes down to for this one all right whos up next music wow live person just picks up the phone thats pretty good did i just hear it right what there are sales people do not do recommendations totally understands 390 chipset integrating yeah obviously which to be clear is not us ripping on janice thats just like cant expect normal people to know what that is okay so ill call up chris roberts from star citizen right yeah chrissy yeah you know like a game that you havent finished yet oh well its only been eight years that fix card say lisa that was it thats the end of the cut in wed just like you cant even what even happened there thanks so whatd i get did we just not buy a system like did cyberpower just lose an actual sale because just to be very clear to the viewer right now we are spending our actual money to buy these systems they actually get our money and cyberpower just didnt get our money because they couldnt pass the most basic hurdle in the sales process and i have money i need system you would say i money give ezpz profit holy sh now agent janice did four try and follow what the guy just told her just sort of systems by price and the site their site is it cost oh yeah its like looks like a freaking walmart fly or something you know they imagine somebody with like 1500 hardearned cash just being subjected to this oh no just google it basically yeah basically i know im calling im looking into ok well thats pretty good go straight to a live person pretty much yes 10 seconds is like bear your weight yeah thats great okay oh wow i cant believe it took this long we are four sis in and this is the first time weve been asked what games the one ian has right now i know it seems kind of average i dont know i think hes necessarily okay so its a good thing it doesnt take a long time to get a human because you gotta call them back then they dont send your your quote no quote again so thats pretty good it only takes a minute to get into talking to someone again at least they yeah well the previous session was like more busy i guess so they actually were put in the queue and over and over all trim to call back yeah not too bad not too bad the first call was so good but this whole process is getting really dragged out why dont they just give her their email address and then stay on the phone to make sure they get it so they can reply to it like if youre ever not sure thats like 101 level stuff if she did get the quote hed get a list okay and they actually sent him a link to their configurator with preselected parts okay yeah and what was interesting is 9000 series part is listed in it really even though thats touched it has the cost he sent us so so theyre pre selling it yeah so pre ordering essentially but within a full system interesting all right i mean there are announced right but this guys head for sale with pricing i mean a system integrator pricing but nevertheless you got it okay alright so the beers go to north modify anything just click as is this what the guy told us okay hits fits the budget lets go okay next next system lets be quick ten seconds from the author outer to the live person okay okay hes not trying to sell the paint job too hard see this is guys another way to do it just have her look at it at the same time yeah shes guiding her through this site the thing hundred dollars i mean thats a good recommendation to upgrade but like they say eighty six hundred k as an upgrade what does she do it was eighty four hundred what is she doing buying a z three ninety motherboard for an idiot for a core i3 because ninety is bigger than seventy okay for gaming maybe they just brought them in right these guys were doing pretty well until this hundred and twenty gigabytes whoa thats it there is no storage in her system at all hundred twenty you guyss d for her thats right now i mean i will say this i can understand based on how much more click even though he doesnt sound enthusiastic he does at least sound knowledgeable his explanation of the importance of the cpu and like what its for and all that suits the brain of the computer she knows how to explain its like a vine so i can see why people might buy from a boutique rather than from a tier one and certainly better than i buy power cyber certainly better than cyber power but then they get ivo power guy did know what was up he knew yeah whats up okay okay the main gear like 15 seconds from an operator to life person its a good question types of games thats pretty i didnt know main gear had systems that like 800 bucks i mean a pretty sure it has ai three in ten fifteen ninety i yeah but thats what the 800 bucks once you upgraded it should be decent wow she just got recommended an amd system wow 1500 bucks with that set at 1500 you could really go either amd or intel but the fact that he brings it up at all rgv for gaming no gb bothers me if it bothers you after a while you can turn it off he said the fword but i think he said it in a pretty appropriate futureproof is a fallacy now keep in mind like this conversation is happening after hours their office is officially closed for business really yeah hes except trying to save your money black friday wow get a rise to save her money oh damn he just recommended go get a cheap wifi adapter on amazon i like this guy oh here comes the warranty pitch well he stay waits for the last you know oh man all right debs thats like the only anyone who mentioned that he can save the config on our site yeah in case you dont need some time to think about it so i wouldnt have expected one of our boutique a size to be the most low pressure straight talk sales experiences so bottom line here is main gear absolutely ran away with the presales experience i concur i mean that was that was awesome not good descending straight to the point nope i like it id say origin was really good as well if we were ignoring the config after that boy it gets tougher like hp was an okay buying experience i guess  the pirates were like she was not told what shes buying like ever  until she got invoice yet and then i mean i buy power if that had a bad connection i mean they were probably fine yes and for your benefit of a doubt no they just maybe misspelled a letter the ones that really lost here though

__label__1 hello im sam this is my channel this is that wikipedia list and this is that wikipedia list september 3rd 1967 sweden decides to switch from left to right swedish motorists accustomed to left side of the road driving join the growing trend throughout europe the crossover to right side traffic flow that was a crazy day for sweden prior to 1967 sweden much like many other european countries drove on the left most countries in the world in fact began driving on the left because thats how carriages did it and carriages did it that way because thats how horses did it the rules start in the first place because back in the old days most would brandish their sword on their right side so in writing they wanted to be able to respond to an oncoming attacker on the right side archaeological evidence proves that left side riding was the norm throughout much of the ancient world the shifter right side riding came when freight wagons got larger as trade became more common demand grew so teamsters the old term for wagon drivers started adding more and more horses to pull heavier and heavier loads there werent seats on these wagons so teamsters just sat on a horse most chose to sit on the back left horse so they could whip with their right hand since the vast majority of people especially at the time were right hand dominant therefore the teamsters chose to ride on the right side of the road so that oncoming wagons could pass on their left and they could clearly see that their wheels were clear fast forward two hundred years and sixtyfive percent of the worlds population drives on the right side of the road which as it turns out is the worst side to drive on you see humans are naturally rightside dominant as we know the vast majority of the worlds population is righthanded about 90 but the vast majority of the world is also right eye dominant humans actually do have an eye that works better than the other for about 70 percent of the worlds population thats the right eye while driving on the left the right eye will focus on oncoming traffic while the left will see whats passing by this may contribute to the slightly lower accident rate in leftside driving countries anyways lets get back to dagon h the name for the day sweden switched in 1955 sweden held a referendum on the issue of driving directionality and a staggering 83 voted against changing the direction the national legislature known as the riksdag promptly responded by deciding to make the change the rationale was that every single one of swedens neighbors drove on the right and most importat cars which were the cheapest cars were designed to be driven on the right in the months leading up to dagon h every intersection was outfitted with an extra set of signals and signs wrapped in black plastic eight thousand buses were retrofitted with new doors on the right side and the rest were sold to pakistan and kenya new lines were painted on the roads then covered in black tape milk cartons and underwear with the days logo were sold in stores around the country contests were held for songs about the change then finally on september 3rd 1967 at 300 pm the law switch and the entire country had one enormous traffic jam as drivers slowly inch across the white line to get to the new normal no one died that day on swedish roads in fact nobody died the day after as well there were only 125 collisions compared to the average of 164 it seemed that the switch worked however by 1969 collision rates were back to normal it turned out that the roads were only safer because drivers were more cautious as they learn the new traffic patterns ill end with an only somewhat related but interesting tidbit the geneva conventions have a treaty that outlines international rules of the road including the rule that traffic directionality must be uniform throughout the same country the vast majority of countries follow this rule with no problem however the good old us of a holds the territory of the us virgin islands where all drivers drive on the left and therefore the us is technically in violation of the geneva conventions which as the no longer existent country of yugoslavia knows is kind of a big deal anyways
__label__1 today were going to talk about space walk so back in the old days property owners had the rights to their land going up forever and ever in perpetuity but then the airplane came around and smart people realized it you couldnt just go around asking every property owner for permission to fly through their airspace so government societ they would own the air above a certain level in general government decided that property owners owned their land up to 500 feet above ground level and then the air above that going up infinitely was to be owned and controlled by the government this made life easier for airplanes but then america invented space and that made things a little more complicated in most cases satellites and spacecraft orbit around the earth so it would be a logistical nightmare to request permission to enter into the airspace of each nation in an orbit once again smart people got together and decided that those air rights that countries had given themselves should end at a certain level different countries say different things but all of them agree that somewhere between 19 miles above earth the altitude of the highest airplanes and balloons and 99 miles above earth the altitude of the lowest orbiting satellites a countrys claim to sovereignty stops so this begs the question which laws apply in space so lets say an astronaut commits a small crime all in space like i dont know doing a line want a spacecraft this isnt a huge crime against humanity but theyre gonna have to be punished if the astronaut had those happy times on the spacecraft of a specific country it would be clear which country would prosecute if it wasnt a soyuz capsule russia would prosecute if it was in a spacex capsule the us would prosecute much like with boats the spacecraft is considered to be an extension of the sovereignty of that country but lets say mr astronaut did his line while on the moon who would prosecute then the outer space treaty of 1967 says that no country can claim a section of space or a celestial body as their territory so this means that no countrys laws apply universally on the moon well this is where the idea of extraterritorial jurisdiction comes into play in almost every kind citizens are subject to the laws of their own country even if they are outside of the country this doesnt apply when they are in other countries and see other countries laws trump the extraterritorial jurisdiction but when they arent in any country these laws do apply this means that two people in the exact same place can be subject to different laws an 18 year old british astronaut could technically drink on the moon one 18 year old american astronaut could not just to make things a little bit more complicated the rules are different on the international space station this space station agreement the document that outlines the rules of the iss says that in most cases extraterritorial jurisdiction applies each astronaut is subject to the laws of their own country however if for example an american astronaut say punches a french one out of frustration france will be allowed to prosecute american astronaut the same rule applies with property if a british astronaut smashes a canadian astronauts computer canada could prosecute the brit in addition this agreement allows for the extradition of astronauts in all cases regardless if the two countries have a normal extradition treaty this is actually pretty important because russia doesnt have an extradition treaty with the us this means that russia doesnt have to give up individuals who have committed a crime in which the us has the right to prosecute in the case that a russian commits a crime against an american on the iss however russia would be obliged to extradite that astronaut another situation and look at is what would happen if a baby was born in space first off this is a super hypothetical because its unknown if its even possible for a baby to be born in zerogravity and if they were their bones would be so brittle that they would crush under their own weight if they return to gravity its unlikely that any country would allow for an astronaut to have a baby in space because that would be like super unethical but for the sake of argument lets say there was a space baby what nationality would that baby be there is actually precedent for this question thirteen babies have been born in antarctica where theres a similar treaty that disallows sovereignty while those babies were not born in their parents countries they took their parents nationalities the same policy applies in space there are countries however that dont give citizenship to babies born outside of the country so in that case the baby would take the citizenship of the country of the spacecraft they were born in this is the same rule that applies when a baby is born on an airplane in flight they take the nationality of their parents and if thats not possible they take the nationality of the country in which the aircraft is registered and what happens that the baby is born on the moon or mars where there is no sovereignty well i dont know man what do i look like a lawyer but seriously nobody really knows this is just one of many flaws in current space law only 536 people have been to space and all of them were highly trained and were representing their country they just arent the type of people to commit crimes as commercial spaceflight and space tourism develop all these laws will need to be made more clear to prevent future problems gone is the era when these laws can just be figured out when and if the time comes in the near future we could be seeing space mining as well and that will require economic laws and environmental treaties the coming decades will be a fascinating time as we watch not only the development of commercial space industries but also as we lay out the legal and political groundwork needed for the opening of the final frontier following the bombing of pan am flight 103 over scotland a deal with reach between gaddafi of libya and the british government in which the trial of the accused bombers would happen in a neutral country in return the extradition

__label__1 so its rog rig reboot time again and yeah youre coming over here right guys like okay you should have heard him before before the camera started rolling i was like hey do you like our review of a copy lake process youre like no im like okay well then fine so heres how its gonna work your system getting dropped thats right so this is james and were gonna be upgrading his craptastic rig today  alright james so tell me about your system here what was your theme other than a seuss because rog sponsored this ohm i was hoping to have it like one blue cuz thats a pretty fun colors okay well we got the white right black black black black black and gray white hey all right black hey hey white and blue hey lamar got it right fantastic have you ever built a system before ive not youve never built a system before no wow its not really a surprise none of the other ones so first things first have you ever watched like a system build guide before i have maybe not all the way through but a little bit not all the way through no you know can you imagine imagine for a moment okay if you took this approach to everything in your life okay like lets say you know you go for your you know marine training and you go all the way through and then you get to the point where like you know you have to reload the gun and you didnt make it to that part now what guess it wont go so well do you know what the first step is you unpack stuff yes start with this one step one open the box no like that yeah yeah its like thats fine yeah actually no it isnt like that oh oh im ben yeah okay so cpu installation easy lift out and then up this arm right here now look at it closely okay okay now the most important thing here is that it goes down with no force whatsoever okay so if youve been doing any jedi training dont use it all right ah oh my goodness this thing just broke off what are you gonna do now i dont believe thats supposed to come off okay so you have watched itll guide you okran is the hardest part okay so this one has gotta go in here im pretty sure if i go over here yeah all right there we go hey so uh colton what do you think are the odds this cable mod cant works with this power supply this time oh no you know this is not a modular power supply right hold on theres another one that is  was definitely interesting um he definitely knew a lot and i was kind of fun but he has such an interesting personality you think he kind of puts on this persona for being on the youtube videos and he kind of does but hes also that energetic and craziness most of the time go ahead and open that up hey are you old enough to use a knife oh no music okay you got a pretty dank setup now but have you like ever gamed on a highend machine i dont think so have you ever experienced the high refresh rate like higher than 60 hertz on monitor i dont think so no yeah youd know if you had cuz its amazing all right one of my friends has a 1080 okay but he doesnt let you use it no you wont you want to give them a shoutout here for being like super nice and for sharing his stuff yeah chris real awesome do you oh okay so you put those screws through the washers now im not giving you the washers go find your own washers these are mine are there other washers no theyre not okay so next thing we need is the blue and white case thats mostly black it can be blue in your imagination give a strong imagination i think so okay is it blue oh yeah okay so just shove it back towards the io and there you go just like that nice how you feeling pretty good pretty good feeling like youve achieved something today oh yeah well you would because youre the guy who watched as part of a builds guide so this is legitimately i think ive said this a couple times but this is actually usually the hardest part of the build for new builders if you get all these little things and it looks like youre supposed to plug them into the board at all all you do is you bundle them all up you jam them into the blades of one of the fans you just leave it like that see these holes yeah see that im just gonna pop that in there and you flex this out you line up the other side with the holes oh i broke it okay go for it and if it clicks it goes too far oh no im just kidding the click is good so weve got to put this on here so you just got to go grab those nuts okay you came back one nut short man you dropped your nut on the ground leave my your dad sitting here going oh im gonna let him watch these videos anymore why dont we get to the most exciting part putting this fan filter back on backwards and then the right way no why dont you open up your graphics card this thing is i would say pretty much topoftheline except that it is gtx 10 att i support 4g sync your monitor as do you think right oh you got the 240 hertz monitor nice because you have gsync youre actually only gonna see exactly the right number of frames without any tearing or stutter or anything like that look at this documentation its got gold lettering there it is is it heavier than you expected actually its a little bit lighter really see i take all this stuff for granted so its kind of fun for me to see like people having their first experience with like this grade of hardware the graphics card is kind of i feel like the main piece and a lot of gaming pc builds and have such a topoftheline one as the strix 1080 it was pretty fun you wanna put it in right oh yeah okay and then yeah you got a bit move up a little bit though i mean no pressure its only like a 700 graphics card nice thats it thats the performance piece i mean the 7700 k processor the 16 gigs of ram the 480 gig you know pcie ssd how thats like performance  okay you ready sure hit it oh thats not a good sign now im just kidding python go for it its alive alright are you just using sweet to humor me youre using dated slang just to make me feel more at ease no no im genuinely excited so this is cool this is the actual refresh rate that your monitor is refreshing at so thats why no matter what frame rate your graphics card is pushing out you wont see any tearing or any stuttering thats gc all right and may i just say on my old computer at ultralow settings it took like 10 seconds just to load up the map its uh i dont know i get so jaded because i tool around with the stuff all the time but i forget that there are people out there that are actually like waiting you know 30 seconds to get into a game nice youre sitting up like 170 180 fps bad youre actually really taking advantage then of the extra refresh rate of this monitor yeah like that is a lot of updates per second and i can actually like see foliage on the ground yes all my life i had waited to see foliage on the ground in this games they were frustrated i think really made a big difference actually being able to look at people and target them whereas before it was just kind of a mess whoa i im actually getting kills for mines oh thats sad lets show you how to overclock your graphics card look put your your next to the system here that very quiet right yep okay lets kick it up a notch thats the sound of performance so if you want the best possible temperatures while youre overclocking you can just go ham on the fan speed or you can actually use the userdefined here in order to set up your own fan curve then as far as geforce overclocking goes these days its pretty straightforward you drag the power target all the way to the end then you start creeping up your gpu boost oclock gpu voltage makes less of a difference these days than it used to but you cant write weaking it a little bit of all the things that can actually kill your hardware when youre overclocking increasing the voltage is pretty much it looking the computer is fun and getting to meet all of the people from honest media group was really amazing it was really interesting seeing how everything fits together and it was also a lot more simple than i thought it would be just pretty much just plugging things together honestly i think  is on my favorite people i just meet again oh i think that pretty much wraps it up for this episode of rog rig reboot james youve been a pleasure to build this system with i hope you get many many hours of fun out of it doing schoolwork yep so thanks guys for watching and thanks to asus rog for allowing us to hook them up with this unbelievable upgrade

__label__1 its late at night and youre feeling sleepy as you tuck into bed you start getting drowsy and slip off into a deep slumber but suddenly instead of a pleasant dream you find yourself in a dark steamy boiler room and standing in front of you is a familiar figure with a black fedora and plaited glove do you stand a chance against him thats what well find out in this episode of the infographic show you versus freddy krueger could you defeat him freddy krueger was a normal family man with a loving family though under this secret facade he was a depraved serial killer who stalked the children of his former classmates all of whom had taunted and ridiculed him throughout school making his life hell torturing and killing the children he spread their remains throughout town and became known as the spring wood slasher eventually he was caught by the police though a faulty arrest warrant saw him released on a technicality the town took justice into their own hands and burned freddy alive in his boiler room though as he succumbed to the flames he was approached by three dream demons who offered him the power to stalk and kill through dreams accepting freddy became a dream demon himself empowered by fear and gaining power by absorbing the souls of his victims so say you find yourself face to face in the middle of a nightmare with the fabled dream demon freddy krueger how could you defeat him the first strategy will be to remain awake as long as possible as freddy is powerless in the real world and can only strike at you from within your own dreams one good way to stop yourself from falling asleep is the use of amphetamines such as adderall or speed as a stimulant amphetamines speed up messages traveling between the brain and body and taken in large doses have the side effect of making it very difficult to go to sleep while retaining a decent amount of energy if illegal drugs arent your thing you can try legal drugs such as modafinil or perhaps just take your chances popping caffeine tablets however too much caffeine in your system can lead to irregular heartbeat and seizures and staying awake for too long can lead to serious mental disorders such as paranoia depression hallucinations and even psychosis so youre staying awake via a steady stream of caffeine pills or a few hits of amphetamines every few hours what now well your first tactic could be to try to find freddys remains and have them blessed by a priest as freddy still has the soul of a man he is technically being possessed by the dream demons and as such vulnerable to a rite of exorcism its not as easy as just sprinkling some holy water on a bunch of burnt bones though due to a rise in the demand for exorcisms in recent years the vatican recently held a weeklong conference to address the rising tide of exorcisms and discuss concerns over the uneven skills of the vaticans current exorcists the church warns that wouldbe exorcists should apprentice under an experienced exorcist and the risks of conducting an exorcism while unprepared can be dire perhaps though you can use the threat of exorcism to lure freddy into the real world as a dream demon freddy has no more power in the real world than you do and luring him into reality or forcing him into it will completely take away his powers however be warned he may not have supernatural powers anymore but he is still armed with a very dangerous glove full of razorsharp knives you can try and take freddy out one on one with some karate skills but we recommend instead something far simpler a smith  wesson model 629 armed with a 44 magnum round the 629 is a highly portable and extremely powerful sidearm carried by many american hunters for selfdefense against bears in the wild capable of creating an exit wound several inches wide simply follow the old shooters adage two in the chest and one in the head and freddy will be no more but suppose you accidentally fell asleep and freddy lured you into one of his signature nightmares what then the best and simplest defense against freddy is actually quite simple dont be afraid of him as a dream demon freddy is unable to harm his victims without first cultivating an aura of fear freddy accomplishes this by haunting his subjects for weeks gradually building a sense of dread within them that empowers him once the fear has grown strong enough its a simple matter for freddy to kill his victim so your best defense is to simply not be afraid of him the best way to overcome your fear is six tricks used by military veterans around the world six prepare and practice by mentally preparing yourself for your confrontation with freddy you can diminish the fear once it actually goes down her us navy seal platoon commander james waters navy seals spend 75 of their time training for a deployment and 25 of their time on the actual deployment once in the midst of a confrontation youve been preparing for youll naturally slip into a state of preparedness greatly reducing fear number five laughs a stanford university study revealed that people who were trained to make jokes and response the disturbing images dealt with them in a much better way than those who didnt laughing can also release feelgood chemicals such as endorphins in the brain further lightening the mood and decreasing the fear maybe try picturing freddy naked or on second thought maybe not number four breathing fear manifests itself physically with a racing heart and pouring sweat you can fight these physical manifestations by lapsing into a pattern of very deep breaths inhale for four seconds and exhale for four seconds calming your nervous system and putting you back in control number three voice in your head weve all experienced the nagging voice of doubt deep in our brains during stressful times in moments of fear that voice can become amplified and completely override your own thinking tell it to shut up mentally shout over these thoughts like many soldiers who shout words like faster to themselves in order to shift their focus from the fear number to worst case scenario much like the first tip to prepare and practice imagining the worstcase scenario that can happen can mentally prepare you for the emotions that youre bound to experience lessening the intensity once they actually manifest so picture freddy ripping your guts out imagine what it would feel like to have those sixinch long blades of his in your soft flesh and then when the time comes to actually confront him youll find that the fear youre facing is kind of familiar and easier to overcome number one push your comfort zone fear typically comes from experiencing the unknown or dangerous a simple way to defeat fear then is to constantly push your boundaries and expose yourself to unknown and dangerous circumstances just like exposure therapy can combat phobias exposing yourself to more and more scary things can actually the effect that fear from any source can have on you so youre not afraid of freddy anymore perfect now youre in control of the dream and freddy can be your plaything while dispatching him in the dream world isnt a guarantee that hell stay gone if freddy cant make you afraid anymore odds are hes not going to be coming back anytime soon although we still recommend the smith  wesson so how would you defeat freddy have any tips on overcoming fear

__label__1 a single aircraft carrier is enough to markedly change the level of a nations military might these ships are one of the strongest single assets a military can have in general under international law aircraft carriers can legally position themselves up to 14 miles or 22 kilometres from any countrys coast clearly the strategic influence of being able to place a military airbase just miles from any coast in the world is enormous especially given that 80 of the worlds population lives within 60 miles or 100 kilometers from the ocean while plenty of military vessels are capable of launching helicopters there are just 19 aircraft carriers worldwide currently in service capable of launching fixedwing airplanes china thailand india russia and france each have one italy has two and the us has the 11 largest in the world these largest carriers require over 6000 people to operate and often stay deployed for up to a year they are fully fledged cities at sea the most advanced aircraft carriers like the french navys charles degaulle are capable of launching an aircraft every 30 seconds that means that for a brief period when launching aircraft at its maximum rate the aircraft carrier charles de gaulle becomes busier than charles de gaulle airport in paris to be able to achieve such a capability on a moving ship is no easy feat while the operation of these vessels gives militaries enormous strategic advantage they also represent one of their greatest operational challenges an aircraft carriers offensive weapon is its aircraft on board carriers tend to only have a small number of defensive weapons such as surfacetoair missiles and machine guns but of course just like any powerful military asset these carriers are big targets it is for this reason that carriers never travel alone while on deployment well the exact composition can change depending on the mission two carrier strike groups american carrier travel with are typically made up of a guided missile cruiser equipped with tomahawk missiles two guided missile destroyers an attack submarine and a supply ship an aircraft carrier is the flagship of this strike group meaning that in its command area it not only has a bridge and an air traffic control center it also has a flag bridge when admiral commands the entire strike group each of the group ships serve some combination of offensive and defensive roles the only exception is the supply ship most aircraft carriers dont need regular fueling all 11 american carriers and the french one are nuclearpowered meaning they can sail an unlimited distance for 25 years without refueling even conventionally powered aircraft carriers like the uks hms queen elizabeth can travel up to 12000 miles or 18000 kilometers without refueling making the need for stops infrequent while an american or french carrier could hypothetically sailed nonstop for years or even decades what they cant do is carry enough food which is always needed an aviation fuel which is needed for combat operations to stay at sea for more than a few weeks at a time it would be inefficient and place the carriers in a position of vulnerability to have to visit a port every few weeks to restock especially during combat operations so they dont they restock while at sea the supply ships that move as part of the strike group will sail off to a nearby port to take on fuel ammunition food and mail sail back to the strike group then match speed and maneuver longside the carrier from there the two ships will shoot lines across to each other these lines are used to pull hoses over to the carrier which are used to transfer aviation fuel to transfer solid supplies there are two methods the first is attaching pallets to dollies that wheel cargo over to the carrier like a zip line the second method which is considered simpler yet more dangerous is using helicopters to pick up pallets from the resupply ship and flying them over to the carrier these transfers bring both crucial supplies like food and some less crucial items like mail but this isnt the only way mail arrives on american aircraft carriers each carrier actually has a mailing address just like any building in the us for example this is the uss gerald r forge address families of sailors can send mail to these addresses in the same way that they could to any other and in fact it cost the exact same as a shipment to any other us address even if the ship is on the other side of the world sailors can even order packages online to their ship expedited mail often makes it from an address in the us to a carrier sailing somewhere around the world in just 10 days having this speed requires more frequent deliveries than those of the logistic ships but conveniently carriers are airports at sea american carriers currently use a fleet of c2 greyhounds as cargo aircraft providing a high frequency often daily connection between carriers and shore when cruising in the south china sea for example as the uss ronald reagan did in november 2018 mail might be sent to singapore by conventional means a c2 greyhound would then fly from the ship to singapore pick up the mail and fly back to the ship as carriers sail around the world the pickup points of the c2 greyhounds are continuously shifted to nearby friendly nations while mail does wonders for increasing crew morale thats actually the lowest priority cargo for the c2 greyhounds the aircraft are integral for bringing on spare parts for all the carriers aircraft and transporting vips press and other individuals to and from the carriers the c2 greyhound is about the same size as an embraer 145 a civilian aircraft capable of carrying 50 people so its not tiny the longest aircraft carrier in the world which also happens to be the newest is the uss gerald r4 but even she is only 1106 feet or 337 metres long with commercial airports a runway of 5000 feet or 1500 metres like the one at london city airport in london is considered short while large airports like london heathrow will have runways longer than 10000 feet or 3000 metres so how do you see two greyhounds and other aircraft on carriers deal with having runways of only 1100 feet or 330 metres long they dont they take off with just 325 feet or 99 metres of space all us and french carriers use a system of catapults to get aircraft up to takeoff speed within three to four seconds this allows these carriers to launch a decently sized aircraft like the c2 greyhound with their relatively short decks other carriers like the chinese and indian ones dont have catapults so they can only launch lighter shorter range aircraft capable of taking off with a very short runway both these two types of carriers have arrestor wires that aircraft catch on landing to decelerate with a short distance given every other aircraft carrier out there can only operate with aircraft capable of vertical landing what takes place on the flight deck is carefully choreographed chaos on american carriers everyones job is easily identifiable by the color shirt they wear yellow shirts deal with navigating aircraft around the deck blue shirts are assistants to yellow shirts driving tugs operating elevators delivering messages and more red shirts to all the handling and mounting of ammunition purple shirts manage aircraft fuelling green shirts are worn by a few different groups including catapult crews maintenance personnel cargo handlers and more white shirts are also worn by a mix of personnel including those helping aircraft land working as medical personnel and more and lastly brown shirts are worn by plane captains or not those that fly the aircraft theyre individually in charge of overseeing all work for getting an aircraft ready for flight the flight deck is a dangerous place given its small size its so small that all the carriers aircraft cant fit on it but of course just below the flight deck is the hangar a large carrier can carry up to 100 aircraft so massive elevators bring aircraft from the flight deck to the hangar for storage when not in use about 6000 people work and live aboard each american carrier 3200 of them have jobs related to running the ship itself that includes everything from working in the engine room maintaining the nuclear reactor cleaning the decks to actually working up in the bridge commanding the ship many of these jobs are below deck and since all the above deck space is used for flight operations many on board can go weeks without seeing sunlight 2500 other personnel are part of the carriers air wing if this was an airbase on land these would be everyone working there including air traffic controllers aircraft mechanics fuelers pilots and more the few hundred remaining personnel work assorted other jobs in terms of personal space enlisted personnel the vast majority of those on board only get a single bunk in a room with sometimes more than a hundred others higher ranked individuals though of course have more spacious accommodations as longterm homes for thousands of people these ships also have a few small luxuries like stores gyms barber shops lounges and more the space is at a premium when six thousand people are packed into one floating hall and the mission is paramount since their heyday in world war two some have started to question the place aircraft carriers have in modern warfare every operating country aside from the us ten to at any given moment have their ships either in combat in training or at home the us tends to use as carriers for a fourth function power projection at any given moment there is almost certainly an american carrier cruising somewhere in the world in fact january 2017 was the first time since world war two that there was not an american aircraft carrier on deployment even if there wasnt an aircraft carrier on deployment theyre fast they have a top speed of 35 miles or 56 kmh meaning that in norfolk virginia based carrier kick it to the middle east in just a week in the pacific the us has an even greater advantage since it has the uss ronald reagan based in yokosuka japan from where it could reach the shores of north korea for example in just 29 hours american carrier spend plenty of time just cruising around the worlds oceans reminding other countries of the uss military power for example the uss ronald reagan returned from a fourmonth deployment from august to december 2018 during which its all zero combat it spent much of the time cruising around the south china sea an area in which china is attempting to assert military control much to the uss displeasure elsewhere in asia american carriers also regularly make visits to the korean peninsula to remind north korea of their presence this reached a peak in november 2017 as tensions with north korea reached a peak when three american carriers loomed near korean shores with their enormous power though aircraft carriers represent an enormous target especially in the era of stealthy drones and precise missiles the sinking of a single us aircraft carrier could result in more american military deaths than the entire iraq war in addition to the loss of tens of billions of dollars in military assets wellnot aircraft carrier of any nation has been sung since world war two its potentially more possible than one would think us carriers regularly participate in war games where combat conditions are simulated with allies there have been two concerning incidents in 2005 and 2015 where swedish and french submarines respectively have won the games against us carriers what this means is that the two countries submarines approach close enough to the carriers where they could have if they were an enemy in real combat launch torpedoes and potentially sank the carriers this in essence proves that aircraft carriers with all their defense are not as unsinkable as some may say meanwhile the us has already received the first of 10 in a new class of carriers while china india and the uk each have carriers under construction so despite their possible obsolescence we can be sure that the aircraft carrier wont be leaving the worlds oceans anytime soon i have a logic question for you suppose there are two doors and the first is a sign on it saying if this door is safe the other door is deadly if that sign is false what do you know about

__label__1 so the other day i was shopping for us stateoftheart cpu for my gaming and productivity pc when i realized that intels latest 5820k and 59 30 k both have six processing cores with hyperthreading both have 15 megs of cash they have a clock speed difference of only 6 and yet the difference in retail price is around 200 woah oh theres the gotcha the 5820k only has 28 pci express gen3 lanes you know the electrical connections behind the slots that we use for graphics cards and other expansion cards compared to 40 on the 59 30 k what a strange way for intel to differentiate its midtier 20113 cpu from its entry level 1 course our gaming rgb keyboards feature precision cherry on x rgb key switches for sixteen point eight million color perky backlighting for virtually unlimited customization click now to learn more lets start with a brief explanation of what pci express or pcie lanes are and what theyre good for unlike previous expansion slots like agp and pci pci express has a physical size and an electrical operating mode that can be independent from each other power is provided by the pins near the key in the connector and the rest of the connector is used or not used to provide more or less bandwidth to the device that is plugged into it the more bandwidth the more lanes are said to be being used for communication the most common speeds are 1 x 4 x 8 x  16 x so heres a cool fact the different bus width cards and slots are actually interoperable that means that installing a 1 x card in a 16 x slot is fine and you can even go the other way around in this video i cut out the back of a smaller slot and put a larger card into it all that happens is that both the slot and the card will now offer at the speed of the lowest link in the chain so thats whats gonna happen if we plug our pcie 16x graphics card into what appears to be a 16 x slot but if the cpu in our system doesnt have enough pci express lanes to provide the full 16 lanes your motherboard manual will give you more specifics with a slot by slot breakdown of how its going to work but basically itll simply interface with your pc at a lower speed usually 8x well that sounds horrible linus wont cutting the link speed to my graphics card in half tank its performance not necessarily were on the third generation of pci express with each new generation doubling the theoretical speed of the previous one that means a modern gen 3 pcie 16x slot can communicate four times faster than an original gen one 16x slot or another way of thinking about this is that a gen 3 4 x slot is equivalent to a gen to 8 x or a gen 1 16 x slot but while we already know that from countless articles that exist on the topic in the past that no previous generation of 8 x lot has bottlenecked a then modern highend graphics card with x99s positioning as the high performance platform of choice for enthusiasts and for gamers i think its fair to say that folks may be running not just one but two or even more graphics cards at a time and this is where concerns start to arise especially given that amd and i suspect also nvidia is starting to do more intercardiac spresso n running in crossfire and again i suspect sli versus relying on those dedicated connectors on the top of the cards so lets introduce the test to eliminate the variable of a slightly different clock speed of the two cpus and since overclocking k series chips is so easy these days were gonna run both processors at 4 gigahertz a very conservative overclock that anyone should be able to attain for the rest of the bench weve got a gigabyte x 99 gaming 5 4 way of select compatible motherboard with 16 gigs of ddr 420 400 megahertz memory from a data thanks to both of them for providing the hardware for the test bench were going to be using for nvidia geforce gtx 980 for graphics cards and were gonna be running all this off of course 3x 1500 eye power supplies so that nothing melts during the benchmarking process and here are the numbers fraps was used to take average frame rates for each of our standard test friends and all games were run at 4k on pretty demanding settings to ensure that we were pushing the hardware as hard as possible as expected a single graphics card config is not affected in any way since its running in 16x mode on either cpu but dual cards will be running at 8 x 8 x on a 5820k and 16 x 16 x so an effective doubling on a 59 30 k so i guess as much as it might be a little bit more counter intuitive they both ran the same so there you go in 3way sli both cpus have to give up at least one 16x slot but again the results are not really affected in any way beyond sort of your standard variants from one run to another and then finally in fourway sli we see oh actually theres a difference here as you may or may not have noticed our 28 lane cpu doesnt have any numbers for fourway sli nvidia requires graphics cards to be plugged into an 8x slot at least for sli certification so only 40 lane cpus have support for this configuration however it should be noted that even at 4k the benefit of a fourth card is fairly small and 3way remains are recommended max config even if you feel the need to spend over a thousand dollars on a bunch of graphics cards to put in your system it should be noted that amd does not have the same limitation for crossfire so you could run for graphics cards if you really wanted to in that case but our recommendation remains the same anyhow so thats the story or at least most of it for gamers anyway compared to the mainstream z97 platform where it should be noted that even the highest end cpus have a mere 16 lanes intels enthusiasts x99 platform in general and the core i7 5820k cpu in particular is a great choice even for multi graphics card gamers if they want to reap the benefits of an extra two processing cores ddr4 memory and higher overall memory capacity limits things do get a little bit dicey for nongamers though when it comes to other pci expansions so make sure that you consult the manual of the motherboard you want before investing in this particular cpu because you may find that the mdot two highspeed storage slots and in some cases even built on ports like sata express and usb 3 headers might not work with too many pci express cards plugged in or even be available at all with a 28 lane cpu so if in doubt head over to the cpus and motherboards section of the linus tech tips comm form where our helpful community will get you sorted out

__label__1 so weve had a lot of people ask us why is it that you go out of your way to specifically hire a hand model for your broll shots but then you never have her actually build the computer and the reason is that max has never built a computer before nope but thats okay because we have a plan today max actually won this cryo rig taku case at our christmas party and resolved to build a computer so because max is actually paying for all the rest of the parts as much fun as it is to do like balls to the wall crazy rigs all the time over here this is gonna be a very value or whatever it is that you do whats it for tumblr mostly its not what you told us before we helped you with the config damn it max photo editing photo editing great thank you and were gonna go ahead and get max through this whole ordeal music you have filmed our videos mmhmm you have watched our videos yes yes dammit whats the first step what do you mean oh the computer motherboard motherboard yeah yeah yeah go ahead go look im here for support all right im not im not here to do it for you configuration for like a photoshop or even maybe light video editing machine pretty much starts at least today until we get lower end chipsets with az 370 boards so this is e 370 i gaming cuz for your cpu youre gonna be using a core i5 8400 now the cpu im going to match this corner here with this corner here there you go its like youre pro you even gave it a little wiggle yep hmm professional all right not bad no way ram yeah yeah so something you guys might have noticed is that the ram were using is not it doesnt have leds it doesnt have heat spreaders on it even believe it or not leds do not make your memory go faster so if all you want is performance then youre better off spending money for extra ram so weve got 16 gigs in here which should be enough for photo editing or video editing even next up anything ah heatsink yeah did you cheat are you over here im not ok yeah youre probably not cuz cooler was actually above ram over here but it doesnt matter oh you have worked here for a year now havent you yeah cuz im kind of sitting youre doing like i i had actually intended to do like a first time or pc build youre actually kind of doing everything right sorry i pay attention which i mean in a good way yeah maybe ill just quit max do you want to take over max do you want to take over maximum tactics i would have maybe thats less than one tech tip we went with the c7 because its low profile and we had one lying around its pretty that was not very  are you sure yes hey this is max on it he thought of everything thats good yeah humor mmm no thats good thats good this thing is in the way just because its your first bill doesnt mean that we cant break out a dremel have you used power tools before max im not allowed okay so were gonna just forget about the power tools youve got a couple of different options i have the hairspray option take max we can use fire can melt it i saw the max survivor what were actually gonna do is use this file okay is it the same rules with nails you can only file one way you bet im gonna ruin my own nails doing this like really worried im far less concerned about your manicure and far more concerned about this very expensive wrap job that we had done on this tip how much this table cost do you have any idea how much automatic your cost less than the table you can psych it threw up for the year you know what i did the math its not good theyre great see how it sits and it doesnt wiggle anymore yes oh wow this is im ruining it like the plastic that matters so this case was modded by the one and only james tried he used plastidip so if you ultimately dont like it then you can just rip it off youre gonna do it arent you wow you know what my favorite colors wow favorite colors red so your favorite color is not blue and purple which we chose because we thought max pc max no okay other particles here hmm okay but this very nice forgetting the io shield that is a very common firsttime mistake i have watched too many computers get built this means our content is working i have no clue very cool warm hot no i see it far theres so many things there are three things so once again on the drives youll probably see that we didnt go what clearly learned how to build a computer for me did you just bump the front of the case with that metal youre gonna damage that beautiful paint job oh my god yeah but its not just about the size the length is also key do you want to hit james after this or should i do it lets together were gonna do this to work nice not bad now what gpu yes thats it time for reassembly lets do it not bad at all i like it shes like yeah i never have hey there we go alright no thats good yeah yeah thats all good its good i mean its not all good yet lets just double check 16 gigs around all detected core i5 8400 very nice there is our one terabyte boot drive there is our 4 terabyte storage drive everything here looks good so far theres our usb drive that were gonna use to install windows maybe accept that windows boot manager is already there so whoops not something to do oop oop yeah its working yeah i dont know what im supposed to be looking for why would you do that what is wrong with you okay so thank you guys for watching maxs first ever pc build it was a success so good job but im not gonna fist bump you because youre gonna do the weird trailer hitch thing its wrong its bad its awful

__label__1 if youre knowledgeable about serial killers and have done your reading or even watched a few of our shows on the topic youll know that many if not most of these killers dealt with some kind of trauma in their childhood wickedness usually has its genesis and that is often a messed up family abusive father overbearing mother molestation abandonment oppressive religious zeal etc but its not always the case and we might ask if evil is sometimes more nature than nurture it might also be likely that the children of violent parents will learn to detest such violence the kids of cruel parents might end up being angels but its likely theyll bear some scars today well look into the kids of actual murders and see how they grew up in this episode of infographic show seven children of serial killers number seven the daughter of ted bundy well start with ted because for the american people he seems to be the epitome of the psychopathic killer a stalker a slasher a boogeyman in a suit that sneaks into your room and kills you in your sleep he was also known to be a necrophiliac so its hard to top ted in terms of evil he did have a child and her name was rose was she the flower for the thorn of her father she was born in october 1981 and is now 36 years old teds exwife named carol ann boon gave birth to rose while he was in prison carol never said much to the press over the years about rose but on one occasion said that she was kind and intelligent its rumored that rose changed her last name and possibly has had two kids of her own who might well be watching the show today they might also not know who theyre notorious grandfather was there are some people on quora who seemed to think they know something about rose stating that shes a good christian another person wrote she is currently living a happy life in anonymity she changed her name and she and her mother are still alive and happy we dont know if thats true but it seems rose bundy certainly hasnt been making any headlines number six the son of uri chikatilo now lets look at the person often called russias worst serial killer while the rostov ripper was busy killing and mutilating 52 women and children mostly in the 80s and 90s he also had a child called you junior how did junior get on in life well it said during his life he also went to the dark side being charged with fraud and extortion a uk tabloid adds rape racketeering and kidnapping to that list but we cant find another source to back that up and uk tabloids are less than trustworthy at times the russian press tells us that in 2009 he was arrested for stabbing a man several times in the belly in a bathroom in ukraine although yuri said he was only partly to blame telling the cops the man had stolen his car and the two guys got into a scrape number 5 the daughter of keith jesperson we know more about this killers daughter because she has talked openly about her father keith who raped and killed at least eight woman in the usa in 1995 the truck driver became known as the happy face killer as his trademark was to leave a painted happy face near victims or on letters he sent to the media his daughter melissa moore told oprah winfrey that she had seen glimpses of her fathers cruelty during her childhood i could hear the cat screaming she said tearfully telling oprah how her sadistic father had put a cat in a barrel doused it in gasoline and set it on fire it took her a while to come to terms with what her dad did saying i couldnt see the heinous actions that he committed i couldnt wrap my head around it it was just too big for me she wrote a book about her life and even hosted a tv show called monster in my family number four the son of gary ridgway known as the green river killer this man was convicted of killing 49 people in the 80s and 90s in washington state and so is one of americas most prolific serial killers his son matthew has talked openly about his father who he said was just the normal dad a soccer dad in fact turning up to support him during his games even when i was in fourth grade when i was with soccer hed always you know be there for me i dont think i ever remember him not being there matthew 1029 told investigators in 2001 they would hang out during the weekends and eat donuts ride bicycles all the while the doting father was killing women he once even picked a woman up with his son in the car the two went off but the woman didnt return he told matthew she had decided to walk on another occasion he had intercourse with the dead body of one of his victims while matthew was sleeping nearby he said his dad never even cursed or ever yelled at him talk about family secrets number three the son of joseph calendar michael calendar was one of at least seven sons of joseph a schizophrenic serial killer who had been horribly abused as a child himself it said joseph killed one of his own sons joseph jr over a life insurance policy young michael though would see the horror of his dads ire firsthand in 1973 he took michael across three us states on a rape and murder spree getting into peoples homes by pretending he was a salesman and bringing along his innocentlooking son once inside the victims were often tied up and brutally murdered but it seems michael had a hand in these crimes according to eyewitness testimony although it was said he was under his fathers control he was still put on probation until he reached 25 years old one source says he then changed his name and was never seen again joseph died of a seizure in prison in 1996 number two the daughter of dennis rader mr rader aka the btk killer murdered at least ten people from 1974 to 1991 in kansas usa he was called btk because of his signature bind torture kill this former cub scout leader had two children one of whom has been outspoken about her father and her life her name is carrie rosen and since her fathers arrest she has suffered from depression ptsd not to mention being hounded by the press she said all she wanted was a quiet life but she later came forward when angered at a stephen king novel ax that was supposedly based on what happened in her childhood home the story suggests that careys mother knew about the murders so carrie spoke to the press after a long silence saying all of a sudden this famous writer is talking on television about my family i just had enough and decided to finally say something and stick up for my mom in 2017 she was working on her own book called someday my heart will mend holding on to faith surviving the trauma of my dad the btk serial killer talking about the writing process she said its helping me to work on it to face what my dad did and to deal with it and finally number one the son of fred and rose west no doubt youve seen our show on perhaps the most gruesome husband and wife that has haunted the halls of serial killer in the english couple had so many kids we cant talk about them all and of course they killed two of their own children burying one of them in the garden at the house of horrors known as 25 cromwell street lets focus on stephen west who has been outspoken about his life and his very peculiar parents in 1995 he and his sister were interviewed talking about the book date coauthored and their lives growing up i couldnt get a bank account or a loan or anything you would fill in 25 cromwell street as your previous address and they either thought it was a joke and chucked the form away or didnt want to know stephen said he said he couldnt get a job because of his name and he was followed around by social services and police some of whom thought he might carry on the cycle of abuse he actually said he worried himself he might turn out that way i sat down and thought jesus christ what if it entered my mind one day to hurt someone i know im so much like my dad in his nature stephen admitted but added he wasnt referring to the violent nature of his father five years later he was jailed for having a sexual relationship with a 14 year old girl the judge was sympathetic though saying you went through an experience when you were younger that no one would wish on anybody stephen was raped beaten and constantly humiliated by his mom rose while he was young not to mention some of the things he must have seen in that house his defense lawyer told the court that this had somewhat skewed stephens outlook on sexuality and what is acceptable up until then he had not committed any other crimes he got nine months the relationship with the girl was a mutual romance he was caught after taking her to a clinic to get her an abortion after making her pregnant he then went under more psychotherapy to help him deal with his traumas and also helped him understand right from wrong so do you have any sympathy for this man even though he got someone so young pregnant how do you think you deal with finding out one of your parents was a vicious serial killer what do you think about the nurture versus nature issue

__label__1 welcome to the mouse house joel zimmerman aka deadmau5 invited us out here to hang for the day and give you guys a peek at the tech setup of one of the worlds most iconic electronic music artists spoiler alert this guy is a big huge nerd and this place is flippin awesome music okay now i know everybody else setting foot into this castle would start with the you know taxidermy route with oh i dont know the taxidermy room or maybe the garage of supercars but not me im starting where the magic happens if you know what i mean the master bedroom and that is an entirely appropriate thing in this case because deadmau5 has turned it into one of the only dolby atmos nick studios outside of dolby themselves you actually need a special black box that he wouldnt tell me serve out in addition to the nine custommade speakers from atc that are perfectly positioned in the room in order to master audio in 3d space remember atmos can scale to hundreds of speakers surrounding the viewer this room have actually been under construction for three years and its still not quite done but its really close i mean to be clear slapping a macbook on the table and chilling out to some sick jams in here is as the kids say dope af but its about like playing csgo on a super computer compared to what it will be capable of and this is really cool so this entire room is actually suspended from what used to be a vaulted ceiling this was done for a couple of reasons number one for improved acoustics and number two so that with access panels under the floor the like 800 cables for these pad panels here or be like banging you know optical displayport cables for the monitors that are going to be installed here can all be run without disturbing the rooms otherwise pristine aesthetic as the gear in here is freaking on real so the neve analog console in the center here would run you about a half a million dollars as configured and honestly that just to take in the inputs apply some eq and compression and adjust levels and check out these walls on the left and right of the center console are different variations of what are called analog modular systems now a lot of folks would produce electronic music exclusively on a computer through software these days but you have to remember that those would be digital reproductions of what is inherently an analogue thing so this wall here is the culmination of over five years of curating and collecting tone generators sequencers filters i mean you name it this ones called the modulation or g how can you not get one of them and joel was kind enough to give us an inperson demo of how something like this works so heres my hip and then plug it into there and then thats the input and then we want to go give you an 80 db output for a filter so im just going from one module to the other if i just say and oh now i want to change the pitch of it to be like a tune right so this is a 1v acht which means one volt per octave i can get these little nuances of turning these analog dials and creating these sounds that subconsciously you probably know arent quite right you know which is me now he obviously doesnt use that for everything i mean its the digital era but from an artistic standpoint whats great is having options an apply voltage on a stepless dial provides practically speaking infinite options which i guess leads us into why there are over a dozen synthesizers in this room now to the stupid layperson one middle c equals another middle c but that is not the case all of these have different tonal properties and many of them have unbelievable stories this juno 106 worth about 1500 bucks he got for 20 at a pawn shop from some guy who didnt know what it was this jupiter 8 and this prophet 10 down here these are really really hard to get your hands on today because they were built in the seventies using components that even if the manufacturer wanted to they couldnt build this stuff again because that stuffs not available today and they have this unique retro tonality that like for example when they went to do stranger things they had to use this equipment because we still dont have the capability to emulate what b sound like electronically but these guys would have gone for a couple hundred bucks in the 70s now there were tens of thousands of dollars this one that folds up in a briefcase right here this is r2d2 i dont mean this is the same model that was our 2d  this was our 2d  it still works and to say this place sounds freaking amazing would be felling it short i mean i only even got to listen to a couple of tracks on the stereo speakers but my god it is an audio listening experience the likes of which i have never come even close to and all of that thats just the surface level lets head down to the dungeon of this modernday castle first up is the land center because why wouldnt you need a land center in your basement this is a boat as trickedout as it gets five a small formfactor custombuilt machines from nvidia with the case is customized by pc junkie mugs to match get this to match joels cars every single one of them is also running a black magic micro 4k camera for game streaming and the capture machine for his game streaming setup here is actually running under this like center pentagram console thing that im standing on and its hooked into their 10 gigabit home networking solution you heard me right i found the only other person in canada with a server room in his freaking house i couldnt be more excited to tell you that its actually quite a little bit maybe quite a bit better than mine not that its the competition not that im upset its just that that is where the two gigabit internet connection comes in from the 103 foot tower with ubiquity freaking dishes on the top out in the yard this one right here this is a custom box with six beams and vineya teslas in it that sounds like a freaking jet taking off and this guy right here this 45 drive store inator is actually the reason this was the this was the springboard for this whole collab because joel reached out to me about a year ago now asking for some math advice so i got him hooked up with the guys at unrep and now hes all set up with 70 terabytes of of course highly expandable storage for all of his music and actually not come to think of it do music files really take up that much space would you even know now of course they dont but the answer the real answer is really freaking cool now i have to confess i never really gave a lot of thought to well how do the graphics on the cube or the helmet sync with the music i just assumed that it was farmed out to some expensive hollywood production house and that it was just kind of done by magic but no joel and his team actually build a lot of these tools and effects inhouse including 3d modeling so most of those gaming machines over there like when there are no friends over playing rocket league are actually being used as render nodes and this is in addition to the teslas in the server room there are a total of i think its 43 nvidia gpus in this house that are all used for rendering so one of the animations for the cube that joel showed us was actually recorded using motion cap from like his microsoft kinect then he used a model from nonstock night redid the head and animated it using cinema 4d then rendered it out using octane and the visualizations and the synchronization to like the head which by the way i absolutely did get to where there is exactly as much sweat in there as you would imagine were designed by him and his crew as well and if youre a networking nerd this is where it gets even cooler so this massive touchscreen thats a relic of microsofts acquisition of perceptive pixel theyre only four in the world by the way can be used through the network and some custom software that him the team developed to allow audio effects and animations to be controlled in real time on a massive touchscreen so pretty much the entire show can be run out of this box with a couple of map pros with this nifty mount on it and this front house mixer well i hope that this whole thing has been at least 30 of fun for you guys as it has been for me because i think its been pretty fucking fun thank you to you guys for watching thank you so much  oh hes standing out in the in the driveway over there but hes waving he i definitely had permission to do all of this thanks to joel for allowing us to hang out here for the day and i guess thats pretty much it

__label__1 everyones been waiting even very famous celebrities for the results of the oneyear airflow test yes my friends we are still running them and we are doing the video but theres only one small problem luke doesnt work here anymore to do the stunning conclusion so were gonna have to walk all the way over to floatplane medias office and get luke to help me check out which one worked or if theyll didnt work music i actually had very little involvement in this project what is going on here well theres any od and in between ii like there was before od has more fans blowing out i think all the fans blowing out any has all the fans blowing in and in between e is fairly balanced they have all been running for over a year behind the old set yeah but then we built this mezzanine that were standing in and then we tore down that set so once the mezzanine was done and before the set got torn down they got moved up here to the office but they were out in the warehouse under the worst possible conditions literally construction zone lets not entirely dismiss the possibility that we will learn something today even if what we learn is that were idiots and we dont know how to perform a controlled experiment so which one is supposed to be the worst by the conventional wisdom i think most people think that all in is the worst okay so lets get the other ones no wait we bleep no no all out is supposed to be the worst but all in these are these are the top and packers this is supposed to be the bad one all out and then it sucks air into the crevices yes okay okay so this is the one we start with so the outside isnt really something to judge because they would have all had a bunch of dust settle on the top and its not that terrible i mean like im gonna do one streak on the power supply i mean its not great not great having a look at our fan though really makes me wonder how it is that people get their computers disgusting enough to be like gummed up well how theres it theres cobwebs that bottom filter was definitely doing something and this is od this is od so that means this one it wasnt pulling through a filter he should have been sucking all the air in from elsewhere so this is another thing we have to be careful with this this is another thing where its fairly casespecific because a lot of cases dont have that huge filtered mesh on the bottom so you can also see here that with the audi case weve actually got a lot of dust build up here and you can assume that for every bit of dust on this yeah more got pulled in yeah actually this is a good thing theyre both sort of a good thing but its a good thing to see so our graphics card does have a dust bunny inside it yeah so thats some buildup so our cpu is good yeah so on the top was good so it actually didnt suck that much in because theyre just blasting everything else yes so the cpu is like sheltered almost because everything around it was like no get out yeah so you can actually you can see some dust streaks on these cable management holes and then but not much i bet you the graphics card was breathing through here and through here how explains clean because its through a filter actually that area of the filter is pretty concentrated any dust thats caught in this filter was already in the computer okay interesting so thats all pulled from inside and these fans have a fair amount of buildup in the mesh lee i think the main takeaway with this one is that even in a construction zone where clearly there was a lot of dusty buildup on top most of your dust is coming into your case from the bottom so if you put your computer on the ground because we didnt have fans blowing out of the bottom thats right yeah you might have a bad time when do the other extreme lets do the test is still bad were already learning something hold on this is the one that is sucking everything in this is everything in so theoretically yeah this isnt gonna be good either well no okay lets start with the bottom okay interesting thats weird the power supply area doesnt have much dust no it doesnt because the air is blowing out of here getting filtered and then being sucked into here theres two fans like hold on theres one two three four five fans worth of pressure going out of here this effectively has a skirt around oh yeah okay so theres dust on this but its not on the inside its on the top yeah its definitely on the top thats so weird okay power supply is completely clean yeah how interesting that is interesting see we are learning things i did not see this one coming that is okay thats cooler than i expected i will definitely give it that well i want to see the franco good its filtering stuff this is telling us that this case is intake system is like not that great because these are about as dust this is the other one this stuff is on the outside cuz thats pulling through that makes sense oh just like wow way when you did that like and its loose which is interesting so our graphics card has no doubt thats a little more than earlier than last time definitely more dust just lying cpu okay theres also definitely more dust on the back ben c female office so gpu is a little bit better but our supply is better this case does not have filters on the top of the back so you dont get to experience so the main takeaway from this one is that more airflow right around an area is gonna give you a much much higher concentration of dust and that again poor planning is ultimately whats gonna kill you yeah is the graphics card better or worse on this one oh its waivers way worse so the gpu over there had to breathe in through this which was very apparent yeah and it breathed in junkie dusty yeah thats right this one is actually breathing good air but thats the only piece and the tars busting i wouldnt have thought that having a filtered fan like blowing towards the graphics card would affect the movement of the air inside like the currents inside enough to be the difference okay so this is sort of the like the recommended way so its neither one extreme nor the other most people would go with a setup similar to this so its important to note that even though weve actually got four fans pulling in and two going out the ones coming in are filtered so these filtered ones coming in should have much less airflow than the nonfiltered ones going out so right off the bat our cpu is pretty good i would say almost us wow almost as good but not quite there is still no not quite at all theres definitely still noticeable dust and that one was like actually clean so this one whats interesting is that even though its using a poor method of keeping dust out of your system what it does do is it focuses all the dusts that it does pull in on the bottom and then sucked it all through that filter for this particular case and here a bit yeah and its gonna change with every case okay should we have a look at the filters yeah okay so as expected this one doesnt have an air curtain around it so the power supply does draw air through the filter filter didnt even stop everything dont filter didnt stop everything at all and theres a lot of customers this is easily the most concentrated wow theres like hairs theres like strands oh okay theres a little bit of that on any yeah that makes sense because these are pulling in right yep yeah and like it plumed okay so thats as expected so no dust bunny in the gpu cpu fan mostly clear this one had more fans and got slightly more total dust which kind of makes sense and the filters are slightly more clogged which makes sense but overall id say its probably more balanced the cpu got hit but not as hard as it did on the really bad cpu case yeah but not as good as it did the other time as well that much is this one yeah the in turn so it ended up being in between which its kind of what we were aiming for we just didnt know is actually gonna work that way here you go then the main takeaways are on your intake fans you want to have filtered air to the greatest degree possible and the more air flow you have the more dusty buildup you are ultimately going to have yeah i think a balanced approach is good but youre gonna have to think about your particular case your particular like if youre on the floor then one of the big things we learned is you want a bunch of exhaust on the floor yeah to keep dust away from your system it actually works yeah yeah and then just enter linus tech tips and the how did you hear about us section so that was actually more enlightening than i thought im surprised i thought they were just all gonna be butchered because of the construction zone so guys

__label__1 the greater boston area in the united states is home to a couple nice universities you may have heard of a few sports teams that you may have also heard of and a museum that youre about to hear about which was the scene of the greatest heist in world history that still remains unsolved two men managed to break into the museum overnight and stole over five hundred million dollars worth of art in just 81 minutes and decades later their identities still remain unknown as does the location of the art they stole so how were two guys able to pull off something so ambitious and how can you still earn a ten million dollar reward today related to the case lets start from the beginning around midnight on march 18th 1990 up to the isabella stewart gardner museum in boston near the museum side entrance two men wearing fake police uniforms waited inside the car for over an hour while only two security guards were present in the museum one of them was a guy named richard who admitted later he would regularly show up to work drunk or stoned but claimed to be sober the night of the robbery he was at the front desk at 124 am when the two men dressed as officers bust the door and claimed that they were responding to a disturbance call in the courtyard and requested entry museum protocol did not allow uninvited guests in a night but since there were st patricks day parties going on around the area the disturbance calls seemed plausible to richard and he didnt know if the rule applied to police officers so he buzzed them in anyway when the two policemen got to his front desk they told richard he looked familiar and there was a warrant out for his arrest they told him to step away and show some identification so he stepped out from behind the desk where the only alarm button to real police was located and then they put handcuffs on him and arrested him when the second security guard arrived from patrol they arrested him too and when they asked why they were being arrested that these told him that they werent under arrest but they were getting robbed so they ducttaped their hands heads and feet and lock them down in the basement the two thieves then went on to ransack the museums art taking paintings from the walls and hacking them out of their frames with knives on alarm went off to alert the guards that somebody was too close to the arts but they just found it and smashed it motion detectors also track their movements the entire time and were sending alerts but it didnt matter because of the museums flawed security these alarms were only meant to alert the onduty security guards and make them push the button on the front desk to actually call the police but since they were a little incapacitated that became impossible over 81 minutes of helping themselves to whatever they wanted they made two trips to their car with 13 pieces of art including paintings by rembrandt vermeer daga an ancient chinese gu and an eagle from a napoleonic era flagged one of the paintings the concert by vermeer is regarded as the most valuable stolen object in the world with a value of over 200 million dollars once the thieves got into their car and drove off into the night with her five hundred million dollars worth of stolen art they were never heard from again the real police didnt show up until 830 am and one of the greatest mysteries in us history began being investigated which 28 years later has found some interesting clues richard for example seems like he knows more than he claimed just about 30 minutes before the thieves bust the door to be let in richard open the side door on the street they were parked on and then quickly shut it he claimed that the museum had taught him how to do that to make sure that it was locked but the timing of it certainly seemed suspicious also interesting to note the motion detectors didnt pick up the thieves on the first floor where a piece was stolen but they did pick up richards movements there before the thieves arrived richard also claimed that despite the thieves not wearing masks he couldnt recall any features of what they looked like to police shortly afterwards but perhaps the most interesting new piece of evidence surfaced just in 2015 a security video that shows richard letting in an unidentified man to the museum the night before the heist took place which could have been a test run for the actual heist later the next day richard claims that he doesnt remember this event taking place despite the video evidence contradicting that more confusingly though is what the thieves actually chose to steal they passed up much more valuable paintings by raphael and bought a celli among others they could have easily taken which suggests the thieves themselves may have been rather amateurish after conducting hundreds of interviews over 20 years the fbi in 2013 announced that they knew the identity of the two thieves but further announced in 2015 that they were both deceased even if theyre not the statute of limitations for their theft expired long ago so they couldnt be prosecuted today if they came forward but they havent anyway the location of the artwork stolen remains unknown despite the museum currently offering a ten million dollar reward for information that leads to their safe returned when the artwork was stolen the museum was in the middle of updating their security but it came too little too late the thieves were able to exploit the situation and help themselves to whatever they wanted without ever being caught or punished

__label__1 has anyone else had enough of the fullsize desktop game intel released their skull canyon nook a tiny gaming barebones all the way back in 2016 it had no dedicated graphics but it still ignited an arms race prompting competitors like zotac and msi to try to pack as much horsepower as possible into the smallest packages possible and intel finally has a followup the hades canyon nook or nu c8 i7 h vk avr and triplea game capable pc boasting an 8th gen core i7 quadcore cpu and amd radeon vega graphics in a package about the same size as a harry potter novel you know what else is novel  music before we get to the new one heres a skull canyon from 2016 the formula that intel followed for the design of this nook was actually great solid cpu lots of io including thunderbolt free and it was easy to upgrade it was basically perfect for a compact computer except for the lack of dedicated graphics i mean this pretty much limited it to easy to run games like overwatch and minecraft which is a pretty tough pill to swallow for anyone paying six hundred and fifty dollars which is a considerable premium over a desktop system for a barebones with no ram or storage but in the last two years a lot of things have happened including evidently hell freezing over because amd and intel came together at last to create this which actually now that i think about it is that where the hades the name came from anywho this thing is pretty o p its 999 dollars for the top tier barebones kit which is pricey but it includes a hyper threaded quad core core i7 88 o 9g and vega mgh graphics or its 799 for the stepdown one that gives up overclocking support and point 1 gigahertz of cpu turbo and drops from 24 to 20 compute units on the gpu first thing i notice about it is its really really heavy for how small it is and that while it is still small it is not nearly as compact as the old ones so it better bring some really impressive performance to the table all panels say for the top are completely covered in hexagonal perforations to allow as much air as possible to be fed into the dual bottom mounted fans as for io its impressive starting with usb we get a total of seven including a type c and a quick charger on the front and it can connect up to six displays including the access to hdmi for a vr headset overall its got more io than many desktops including not one but two thunderbolt 3 ports cracking it open we get a look at the internals now oh check that out so you can see through it thats where the rgb lighting comes through for the skull on the top and then removing this additional screw right here we can lift up this plate to get a look at our options for memory and storage so weve got two sodium slots with support for up to 32 gigs of ddr 4 ram and dual fulllength oops and dual fulllength 80 millimeter m dot 2 slots with support for both ahci and nvme drives as well as raid 0 and raid 1 so were gonna be using an intel octane 800 p for our boot drive and then a regular nvme ssd for our storage drive because like yolo right anyway while were in here we also get a look at the backside of the cpu and gpu so its got this odd rectangular shape to it here and thats for a reason thats because of the way that the rx vega mgh so the h here is for high performance connects directly to the main cpu and theyre actually installed on the same substrate so this special engineering trick which is basically a pci express 8 x link right between them is what makes the system so powerful compact and power efficient compared to other small formfactor desktops alright time to plug it in now and oh that is a beefy power brick that power brick is actually almost the size of the old nook anyway fun fact the eyes the skull and the power button are all separate rgb zones so you can make them any color you want or turn them off if you prefer that sort of thing but thats not the most important thing you guys want to know how it performs and isnt this hilarious this is amd software but just like with an intel skin on it like this so bizarre anyway lets lets get some games fired up and talk performance here we compared hades canyon with intels last generation skull canyon as well as a similarly priced desktop excluding costs for storage ram and operating system and its performance is actually pretty surprising compared to the last gem skull canyon nook hades canyon completely blows it out of the water as intel integrated graphics just isnt even in the same ballpark as the radeon vega chip that the hades canyon uses as for the gap between the new nook and our 8700 k desktop system its pretty noticeable with an average overall increase of about 35 across the spectrum of games and synthetic tests that we used though this isnt bad if you consider the knux 50 lower tdp and its tiny form factor but does buying this nook make any sense well actually especially in light of the pricing of decent dedicated graphics cards right now as a compact minimal htpc the hades canyon is actually pretty awesome like if you told me three years ago that this was running on this id have been looking for the hidden wires but but this is real and not only is the noise not a problem from like a couch distance or even from this distance the performance is good enough to play basically any game even if its not at absolute maximum settings so as long as youre willing to give up future upgrade ability and youll get some kind of a benefit from the size maybe you go to a lot of lands for example its actually not a terrible deal for all the hardware thats included

__label__1 this is the msi gs5 g4 discrete gaming graphics x4 thin light and stealthy six for fifteen point six inches the screen size and five because this is the brandnew fifth generation chassis design which played on a second the last model i saw was a gs 63 so did they just skip gen 4 solely because four is considered unlucky in some parts of asia or is it just that much better honestly this could go either way because in my hands right now is the most important letter thank you h this is the first laptop weve seen with a six core intel core i7 h series mobile gaming cpu oh crap i meant to take the letter off and the first thing that stands out about the gs 65 is how much more premium it looks than its predecessor the industrial design has been simplified the grain finish has been replaced with a cleaner blasted finish and the red pinstriping has been swapped out for a more mature gold but the chassis redesign is more than cosmetic even though its screen is larger than highperformance compact competitors like the razor blade and macbook pro it has a surprisingly similar footprint so how did they pull this off well first they dramatically shrunk the bezels the sides are a mere four millimeters now with the top bezel only about half the size and the webcam while its the same very unexceptional 720p affair from over a year ago to its credit its still positioned above the screen in its optimal location so it doesnt look up your nose and its also got this nifty dipti little hardware button down here that if you press actually disables it outright on a hardware level so all of this adds up to a screen to body ratio of 82 a stat made only a little bit less impressive by the obvious way that they patted it by enlarging this gap back here that you wont be able to unsee the next thing they did was to remove the number pad which is sure to enrage some while simultaneously bringing jubilation to those who hate having their hands offcenter while theyre trying to type numpad or no though the new steelseries keyboard is definitely an improvement the switches are less mushy the key caps are a lot wider and the legend is now transparent to let the now individually controllable ardrey back lights shine through at another shining point for the gs is its io the ports themselves havent actually changed that much from last gen but every usb port runs at ten gigabit spec now and with hdmi 20 thunderbolt 3 and minidisplayport you can plug in up to three 4k 60 hertz external displays at once and i mean pretty much whatever else you could want even the carry ability is better than last time the notebook itself does weigh about the same but the power brick which you do have to take with you so it matters is definitely smaller and lighter the display itself is a 156 inch 1080p ips panel thats calibrated on the box with 95 coverage of the srgb color gamut so nothing really stands out here but it managed surprisingly decent delta e values meaning that colors are true to life and you could definitely use this machine for some casual photo editing or graphic design which is great but what really matters for the capital g gamers out there is its 144 hertz refresh rate the gaming experience on the gs 65 is simply put awesome its compact but this thing is armed to the teeth for the latest titles thanks to its gtx 1070 maxq and 8th gen core i7 8750 h processor the first one of intels shiny new premium mobile cpus that weve seen in the wild clocked between 22 and 4 point 1 gigahertz boost and its only set to get better a little bird told me that unofficial gsync support might turn up later the hardwares in there its just a matter of whether or not it gets the certification and even in professional workstation tasks like rendering the gs 65 performed as well as much bigger not to mention pricier laptops from last gen but many a high performance notebook around here has been brought to its knees by our usability tests the gs 65 s battery life well thats pretty ok for a gaming notebook though considering its hybrid graphics i might have asked for more here and while its 3 fan 4 heat pipe cooling design does look set to handle gaming loads pretty much effortlessly under extreme cpu loads like what you might see rendering out a video we saw significant thermal throttling with our cpu cores reaching as high as 90 degrees after 30 minutes so other than that though sounds pretty good time to buy right well maybe but with competing coffee late gauge series machines like the dell xps 95 70 and gigabyte aero 15x due for launch any moment now you might want to hold off at least a couple weeks to see if those ones are a little bit less fingerprint prone and flexible like i do get that msi needed to keep the weight down but a little more reinforcements like maybe behind the power button here probably wouldnt have been a backbreaker with all of that said theres no denying that the gs 65 is in allaround solid performer that hits the sweet spot between performance and sides i mean it really wasnt that long ago that normal non g laptops used to be this size plus its got insane io and all of that at a price point that is barely above what last gen is selling for so you know what high 4ms i mean i mean five five five msi good job speaking of good job

__label__1 so welcome to fatherdaughter pc build with my son when he was three it was pretty straightforward with this one i think its gonna be a little more challenging i dont like you honey did you put that in the water before this bin right here has most of the stuff were gonna need for today and then this right here is the case that were going to build the computer in can you carry this for me no thanks its too heavy can you carry this for me great job okay should we head downstairs and start building well honestly the one that was on there already is probably the right one see i knew you knew what it was for music thats right okay so something i have to do is take a couple of screws out of here before we start so can i borrow that thank you darling do you like these fans yeah well what color would you like us to make them you want them to be blue did not see that one coming with the theme of this build but sure yeah we can make it blue i just assumed her color preference yes yes i did we will blue and pink okay we can do that no problem so youll have to tell me its white and pink do you like it yeah and its small just like you so you and i are gonna put all this stuff in there you bet so this is the only board on the market that can take an 18 core extreme edition and put it in a tiny little case like this those are for plugging in headphones and microphones and speakers everything is interesting to you into three so this right here is our extreme edition processor do you want to put it in okay so were gonna put that side in where the triangle is so youre gonna hold it kind of like this if you like that gentle gentle gentle music thats it im gonna push it down push push push so were gonna put a cooler on it is that sound good or not this could take forever and you know how to press these things right its like the medicine thing for the baby right okay you know how they work yeah wow good job great job honey awesome job you push all the way done great job okay three oh good job there we go hows that look yeah and were gonna push it down push push push push there we go yeah maybe were strong enough together now this was actually custom done for you by k slabs you know that they did a special color just for you so we need a power supply of course theyre sent over there sf 600 so tac sent over there gt x 1080 ti arctic storm mini this is just about the most powerful graphics card you can get yeah it does do you work on those screws its actually pretty safe thing for her to work on mostly thomas from cable mod did us up some special cables for our power supply  do you like them are they pretty picky man so remember those headphone jacks and stuff back here they all hook through there neat huh oh good job do you want to see an mdot to drive oh can you help me with this one actually sniffing ah youre gonna sip my fittings off i dont thank you maybe you dont like my fittings check that out good helping okay well thats not the case screws but at least i have the radiator screws okay i dropped it is that what you think lets do the power cables for our graphics card do you want to help me with that mmhmm all right thats fine well thats so we ended up with probably not more than an inch of extra wiring for our duel eight pins for the graphics card our eight pin for the motherboard in our 24 pin here this is coming together really well well its not quite done yet i want you to sit with you for a bit so well just continue without my helper of it okay so my previous helper abandoned me so i got a new one im hoping this will be a slight upgrade do you think maybe teddy and you want to come help us with the computer again music honey are you upset because i was working on it without you okay but sweetheart you said that you were done helping me remember you want to help me draw some circles on here all went in i changed it well you know the thing about building a computer is that you actually dont do a lot of snipping that would be more if we were like taking it apart you know hi darling grab on to where are you pulling me up oh youre standing laughs ooh i see the water move around in the loop music whoa oh look at it go oh you cant actually pump it anymore once its on okay i heard our computer is completely bad guy free is that right oh keep out of the water please doubt it hmm honey did you put that in the water before oh no fainted okay because if we painted the computer with water then that might actually be okay do you want to come over and try turning it on no all right wow can you help me press that button all right so here we go check this out cor i 979 80 x e 26 gigahertz what music actually we forgot about something these fittings on the top so walk to the workshop yeah i dont think youre gonna want to witness this kind of carnage anyway all right lets go fire it back up with the side panel on it music what do you think well that is all the information i needed thank you for your help thank you to intel for their help thanks to max for her unwavering patience thank you max thanks to alex for helping out making sure we actually got it done his well as helping them theres help

__label__1 its auction day you know 53 and were freakin late we spent half an hour looking for parking so i dont know hopefully not too much stuff is gone lets go okay so as we thought they are holding the live auctioning on the other side of the warehouse that had been drywalled over so im following the very helpful signs  oh wow we cannot get anywhere near it are we only on lot number two did they just start am i misunderstanding something hey half an hour late and you dont miss the party im not sure if theres a life lesson to be learned here i dont know if you guys went through it much but theres like i kind of really stupid with really high bids on it im kind of looking like what are you doing i think people are misunderstanding there was there was a bin it was a box of stock heatsinks it had a bit of like 350 dollars on it someone thought they were cpus i think hey i just realized something i can bid on for you ed want to buy some useless crap but you dont need oh am i the only one who has a legitimately very difficult time understanding what hes saying i think the system broke again it would be awesome if the online portion just got shut down for the people who showed up here like really good thing did someone really just pay three thousand two hundred and fifty dollars for a 3930k based system did that just happen its very frustrating the the systems dont have the brackets cards listed in them because its like best buy style merchandising i mean were not bidding on any other systems anyway but 5820k processor did that just go for almost two thousand dollars remember this is canadian rupees on top of these prices like these arent tax free prices you got to pay tax and i think its about a 15 fee on top for the auktioner i think people are gonna have a hard time turning some of these systems into a craigslist profit to be perfectly honest i mean i thought it was bad yesterday when i was looking through like we wanted some of those silver racks theres theres a local craigslist seller that just has like everything and it was like 20 30 bucks less i will give them credit even though i cant really understand what hes saying it seems to get things moving really fast theyve moved twelve lots already i think were gonna have to have a bit of a strategy here and i think that strategy if we were smart might have been to not show up until a little bit later because everything in the first half of the day that we had any interest in is probably not gonna make any sense to buy like lets have a look at that bin of microsoft office for mac that i saw current bid 700 unless you just need windows 10 pro licenses like you cant flip them for a lot online because selling windows 10 licenses online is just one of those like sketchy things people arent willing to pay for pop theyre only worth about a hundred dollars and remember thats 900 allin i dont know what just happened there was that an rl series benq monitor that just went for 400 what why heres an rl 2455 on ebay for a hundred and fifty dollars plus 20 bucks and shipping somebody just paid five hundred and twenty five dollars for it thats it no more youtube videos auction auction business get enough to get some food cant handle this right now its amazing how much people pay for stuff at these things theres just theres stuff i just i just found on ebay for a third of what the guy paid a third im getting stressed out in there oh stressed out man everythings expensive madness  you gotta be kidding me but this is a lot of five assorted gpu cooling units heat sinks etc look at this these are coolers but theres no theres no io bracket on them theres no card matthew matthew you own yourself thank you oh yeah right thats why youre leaving right thats why you guys are out of here ncix security technology ow ow this is a problem cuz like i actually need some of this stuff like my play button assortment of motherboards and fans and other probably broken garbage wow fantastic so to their credit theres some boards in there that like might be kind of decent theres a z170 board but this is how its stored you know i wouldnt hold my breath that its working three evga power supplies a 750 gq a 550 g3 and a 450 just went for 500 550 can i just go to my warehouse and let go find some shit and get these guys to sell it because like you know 121 121 point away if i have one in five okay here goes a black widow tournament edition keyboard a hundred and seventyfive dollars laughter so theres a dude right there buying all the keyboards i think i kind of want to talk to this guy like should we talk to this guy hi can i ask you a question the corsair k60 keyboard ok so i think that one was 300 right so did you just kind of get wrapped up in the excitement of bidding and stuff yeah he just doesnt really get about the price i think people are just here for fun people arent necessarily here because they want to get a deal on computer crap i mean imagine going in gambling for example did you go to the casino and you blow 500 bucks you might get nothing if you go to an auction and you blow 500 bucks you might get a keyboard i want to know what people are excited about right now what is this 700 antistatic work mats see this is what linus tech tips is all about bringing you guys the breaking stories the stories that break me no no look at this one is that is that more than one card please tell me thats more than one party special bun 1500 bucks for a 1060 do you think theyre gonna use it for mining or aiming so they only got through about a hundred lots in the last 45 minutes which means that we have potentially like three hours to kill right now so you can go play some squash suckas alright did you google how to play the game okay so what do we do youre gonna wear your gloves for the game are you serious youre driving gloves im gonna get my ass kicked oh god oh damn okay whatd you get whatd you get yeah  250 bucks wireless xbox 360 controller what were you actually after i got a no what were you thinking secret m secret m mouse okay all right you got an nvidia shield how much you guys want for the nvidia shield i dont know i dont even know how much these things are worth a companies just send me there what do i know do either of you want an nvidia shield do either of you even care making parkinglot deals thats a little jit way i just bought this nvidia shield for 95 i dont know all right were back and were ready to bid our lot that we want is 881 881 so were really close oh they were selling late okay we got it we gotta go find that guy did you guys just buy 881 what are you guys actually after in there sorry which one the youtube plaque okay yeah ill buy it off you okay i got a like i got a level with you guys here thats the channel i built thats why im here thats my plaque like ill pay you for it but thats my plaque guys i didnt i didnt realize that this was like a choice auction here the ncix tektips channel like you know who i am okay because i havent worked here for five years so whats your channel the what sorry here can you can eyes can i see so this is your channel youre running this well you know what actually if you dont have one i have two i have one for linus tech tips ive got one for tech quickie i was here to buy this out of sentimental value but you know what honestly you could rebadge this really easily you know what dude massive showed he was gonna do it but tell you what take it enjoy it its the og plaque which is the one you should have exactly and its a lot nicer than the newer one and you probably know so okay im defeated on the play button but at least i have this nvidia shield that i bought in the parking lot okay all right thanks dude really appreciate it its a really nice gesture you know what go ahead though you you should have it put it on your wall and for the rest of you if you want to make me feel better you can go subscribe to my stupid cat channel so i can get a plaque for that and then my feelings can feel better okay im not gonna lie im pretty disappointed in our performance here i cant feel too bad about the play button though i still feel good that someone who appreciates it got it and that it will like mean something to them so i got my nvidia shield which it turns out i should have looked a little closer at it i believe thats an rma number

__label__1 one of the big stories at computex this year was about removing the bottlenecks from high speed mdot to nvme ssds pretty much every motherboard was bristling with mounts and partners like a soos even showed off this crazy card that could hold four drives at a time for a theoretical 16 gigabytes per second of throughput so when samsung approached us to sponsor a video showing off their flagship 960 pro we had plenty of inspiration for how to build the awesomest dream ssd raid setup unfortunately getting it to actually work has been well an adventure yeah music now as the de facto choice for speed freaks for the entire past year samsungs 960 pro needs no introduction but they sponsored this video so were gonna do it anyway each of our four drives has 512 gigs of vnand storage is rated to a blazing fast 3500 megabytes per second reads and 2100 megabytes per second writes has a custom 5 core samsung processor onboard and a fiveyear warranty and somehow the whole thing is the size of a stick of gum so then lets go lets plug them all in and rip up some benchmark scores right wrong finding a board with enough slots was the first challenge we had to solve i thought i saw one at computex that had 5 but that turned out to be a figment of my imagination so we settled ben on the asus prime x 299 deluxe with a separate pci express card to handle the last m2 but one small problem as cool as it is to run windows software raid 4 eye watering sequential performance numbers that has been done to death and besides we wanted to actually experience the speed in daytoday use so that means that we need to boot windows from our array lets talk about intels virtual raid on cpu or vrock since the latest skylake x highend desktop processors share much of their pedigree with server level xeon chips they actually have three what are called volume management devices built in each of which can give up to four pcie 4x devices direct access to the cpu for high bandwidth low latency performance cool the issue though is that today is not yet officially launched and making matters worse intel is rumored to be planning to enable the feature with a hardware key that will only be available through bundles with x to 99 motherboards or ssds thankfully though amd decided to ride in on a white steed and save the day by announcing a free driver update and sadly yes their marketing materials specifically emphasized the free part thats the world we live in now which would enable bootable nvme raid on the x 399 thread ripper platform so a quick swap to the asus zenith extreme and we are ready to cry on the desk because amd pulled the software almost immediately after the announcement due to compatibility issues once it was finally rereleased we then had to bundle our way through the incredibly poorly documented process of a loading the amd nvme controller driver which allows b the amd rate controller driver to be installed which allows c the amd raid configuration to be installed then even when we were in windows running on four ssds we hit another roadblock our iometer benchmark results were nowhere near what amd posted on their blog so after still more research mad props to gary from asus by the way man we figured out that because of thread ripper cpu is technically two separate dies linked by amds infinity fabric interconnect considerations must be made to ensure that the nvme load is balanced between the dies otherwise this 11 gigabyte per second link as fast as it is could actually become a bottleneck so armed with a detailed diagram of pcie lane allocations and a prerelease bios we pushed onward meanwhile though we actually hadnt given up entirely on vrock now while i wouldnt recommend getting your intel drivers from russian download mirrors we did find one that claimed to enable vrock without a raid key and actually it technically worked but our performance numbers were way off compared to the guys at pc perspective who also got vrock working via what we think was a similar method and anyway neither of us could get it to boot with non intel ssds so back to amd thread ripper then which for better or for worse has bootable raid today amd got back to us with a preset for iometer and some guidance to help us replicate their results not while actually booted from it mind you but with a raw as an unformatted file system and we implemented everything meaning that it is finally time to do this so after physically balancing the for samsung 960 pros between the dies using a seusss dim dot 2 for 2 of them and theyre hyper m2 x16 card for the other two we booted in pure uefi mode and configured our array using the builtin raid expert 2 utility we then f6 to all three drivers in order and saw our two terabyte array as available for os installation once booted into windows we launch diameter with one megabyte reads and writes at 32 q depth and had to rub our eyes at the results 12 gigabytes per second on reads and 73 gigabytes per second on writes and that is without amds bs bra filesystem stuff we are talking a fully operational ntfs formatted bootable array with those kinds of numbers for comparison a single 960 pro delivered three and a half gigabytes per second on reads and two gigabytes per second on writes in the same machine now crystal disk mark didnt scale quite as well on reads but we do have to keep in mind that this technology is still in its infancy at least on the driver side and we might actually see more of the raw hardwares potential unlocked in the future so thanks to samsung for sponsoring this x raishin of highend bootable raid on the desktop i dont think this crazy ride is quite over yet but were gonna take a little breather and then maybe well revisit it once things have settled down particularly on the intel side over the next few months

__label__1 so one of the most ancient struggle in humanitiess existence is our fight fight for survival with nature and more specifically our struggle to survive against animals humans have struggled with animals since well pretty much forever and even in the 20 and 21st centuries nature will often get the better of us many of you will have probably heard about the great emu war in which the australian government went to war with modern machine guns against their emus population  and failed this is a similar story but even more wierd lets start with where the story takes place the galapagos islands in the pacific ocean that are a part of ecuador the island are famous for their biological diversity which was so great  it was the place that helped charles darwin to develop his theory of evolution there are several animal species that can only be found on the islands like the galapagos tortoise the largest tortoise species in the world but then goat started arriving and became the greatest threat to the native species of the island that theyve ever known the islands are over 900km away from  the south american mainlands so they didnt swim  they were brought by humans who thought it was a great idea at the time the spanish brought them for food and released them into the wild but when they found out that british pirates were settling the area and fighting these goats for their own food they released dogs into the wild to try and kill them that didnt work and then on one of the islands in 1959 a couple fishermen brought just 3 goats that also escaped into the wild one male and two females just 14 years later it was estimated that those 3 original goats had exploded into a population of over 30000 goats that were rampaging across the islands by the 19 90s the goat the problem began to get out of hand with the goat army over 25000 strong it was destroying the natural habitats of the islands they were eating everything they could find which was destroying the food eaten by the islands native species as a result creatures like the giant galapagos tortoise were starving to death their own numbers had decreased form over 25000 down to just 3000 left by the 19 70s the goats were creating an environmental disaster and concerned biologists began brainstorming potential solutions it was eventually decided that the native wildlife on the islands needed to be saved and the only way to do that was to remove all the 250000 goats rounding them all up and transporting them somewhere else somewhere else was decided to be difficult so several other crazy plans were developed instead including one idea to import lions to the island s that would eat the goats they eventually decided that was dumb but agreed that an all out war needed to be declared on the goats and every single last goat on the islands needed to be destroyed and for that they brought in the military after after years of debating  and planning the galapagos conservancy initiated project isabella the systematic killing of all goats and other pests from the galapagos islands the began at first simply with squads of hunters crossing the islands and shooting as they found them but this was determined to not be terribly efficient or quick enough so then they brought in helicopters with trained sharpshooters brought in from new zealand to fly around and mow down the goats in herds there would be two gunners on either side of the helicopter and when the pilot managed to herd a group of goats together into a tight pack they would open fire and wipe all of them out this tactic proved effective because within in the first year starting 90 of the islands goats had been eliminated the remaining 10 meant thousands of goats where still out there though and they started going under ground the surviving goats grew wise to the sound of helicopters knowing that their sound meant instant death they scattered and fled to the hidden parts of the island and continued gorilla style war against their human attackers you already know how quickly just three goats managed to reproduce into 30000 goats so even if only a handful remain the environmental disaster they were causing would restart all over again eventually all bold new strategy had to be developed to finish the war and so project isabella came up with the idea of judas goat essentially a team would capture a female goat from the wild tag it with a gps tracking device and release it to go find its friends the hunters would follow the goat back to the herd and just like judas it would betray its friends to be slaughtered once the herd was eliminated the hunters would always leave the judas goat alive to go find new friends to start the entire process over again everywhere the judas goat went it unknowingly would bring death it over two more long years the team employed over 900 such judas goats to finish the war by 2006 it was declared that the main islands were free of goats for the first time in centuries and the vegetation they destroyed was begging to come back the galapagos turtle population has since rebounded to over 19000 so the operation has achieved its goals that being said project isabella is not without controversy the slaughter of a quarter of a million goats was and is controversial today to some but their deaths met the saving from extension of several other species it should be humanitiess responsibility to protect all life on our planet because were the only species cable of understanding how to do it one of the biggest threats to life on earth comes in the form of asteroids from space

__label__1 weve covered quite a few strange disorders recently not to mention diseases conditions and even just painful things that can happen to you but the topic of todays show might be one of the saddest and most horrifying specters that nature can do to a person if youve seen the documentary film the diving bell and the butterfly youll already know we are talking about and why we say this syndrome can be very sad for the sufferers and anyone close to them if you can imagine it happening to you you would no doubt agree this is possibly the most frustrating of all human conditions but let us now explain what we are talking about in this episode of the infographic show what is lockedin syndrome okay lets start with the movie we just mentioned the diving bell and the butterfly imagine this you are a famous editor leading a team at elle magazine in france youre a handsome socialite clever funny and live an exciting and invigorating life you have two children that you dearly love then one day you have a stroke and fall into a coma 20 days later you awaken except you dont really awaken not fully you can hear and see think and perform any mental tasks you want but you cant move you are locked in this happened to the editor in question jean dominique bobby in 1995 when he was just 43 years old he wrote a book while he was in this condition as the one thing he could do was blink and while it was utterly laborious he blinked the letters of the alphabet using a special system to someone taking notes heres a quote from this blinking dying man i am fading away slowly but surely like the sailor who watches his home shore gradually disappear i watch my past received his condition is often called a pseudo coma because in many ways you are still in a coma perhaps mr bobby was fortunate though in view of the fact that he didnt have total lockedin syndrome that is when you can still think but not move anything at all you are still thinking but no one knows that you are scans however will reveal that there is activity happening inside of the brain in the case of lockedin syndrome 50 of the time its the persons friends or relatives that usually notice the patient blinking at them in a way that shows that they are conscious lets explain some more the main cause of lockedin syndrome is brain stem hemorrhage this is bleeding in or around the brain which could be caused by high blood pressure extreme drug abuse brain trauma tumors infection or heart disease it can also be caused by something called infarct which means the dying or in medical terms the necrotizing of tissue this is because the area has been deprived of blood for those that have a stroke about 1 percent will develop the condition of lockedin syndrome if you have lockedin syndrome you could be like that for a long time especially if you have constant care around you you cant really do anything on your own and that includes breathing so you need help for that it cannot be treated as such but you may live as long as 10 years since the disaster first strikes in very rare cases people gain some motor function back and even in fewer reported cases people made a full recovery while most people have their cognitive functions fully intact a national center for biotechnology information report tells us that in one study consisting of 44 people with the condition 8 people said they had memory problems and 6 others had attentional deficits some people even retain their proprioception something sometimes called the sixth sense which is the ability of the mind to know what the rest of the body is doing or where parts of the body are what about those two people that seem to miraculously come out of being locked in one of them was a british woman called kate allen who had a stroke in 2010 and later woke up from a coma she knew shed woken up she even thought about her chores but she was locked in while this may sound like a good thing unlight of almost being dead she wasnt happy at all especially as others didnt realize she was thinking and worse feeling she told the bbc in 2011 i wanted a pillow over the head i hated it my life was nothing like it was and i was going to be forever an observer in my kids life i just wanted to be put out of my misery but then one day she noticed she could move her thumb if only very slightly she later learned how to speak again and some time later walked out of the hospital in 2009 a former british police officer called richard marsh had lockedin syndrome and he too has recovered well 95 percent recovered he told the guardian my brain protected me it didnt let me grasp the seriousness of the situation its weird but i can remember never feeling scared i knew my cognitive abilities were 100 he said one of the worst things about having the condition was when his wife was in the room with the doctors telling her he had a 2 chance of survival and if he did come out of the coma they didnt know he was locked in he would be a vegetable i could hear the conversation and in my mind i was screaming no he told the guardian tony nic linson a british man who had a stroke in 2005 and then lockedin syndrome actually wanted to die and fought the british government for the right to do so by means of euthanasia he could communicate with his eyes but he said the condition was exhausting and the life he had was undignified the guardian even arranged for an interview with the man with the public via twitter when asked if using twitter made him feel better and want to stay alive he tweeted back no cuz i still cant speak speaking is important to me and twitter cannot alter that asked what his first thoughts were when he came around from the stroke and realized he was locked in he replied bloody hell this cant be happening i dont want to be paralysed he said even though no life is a sad thing to think about ending it all is all he thinks about in 2012 after never meeting the government for his right to die he died at home from pneumonia on that sad note we will add another sad note the day we are writing this show is the day that great stephen hawking died hawking didnt have lockedin syndrome but most of his body was paralyzed due to a mia traffic lateral sclerosis a kind of degenerative motor neuron disease his ability to communicate with the world in a physical sense was never easy but his words will go down in history so on this day wed like to say rest in peace to mr hawking a man that beat all the odds this will of course be a belated rest in peace when you hear it so how do you think you deal with lockedin syndrome with the stressful and difficult communication with your eyes be a good enough reason to live or would you want to have your life taken away how about those few days when no one even knows youre awake

__label__1 ever since the first nuclear weapons test in the deserts of new mexico and the bombings of hiroshima and nagasaki nuclear weapons have become significantly more powerful since the first test in new mexico by the united states in 1945 2475 nuclear weapons have been detonated across the globe over 85 of those detonations have come from only two countries however in the united states and the former soviet union only two of those thousands of detonations were ever used in a war the ones drop on hiroshima and nagasaki during world war two by the united states but those bombs were very small compared to modern weaponry the hiroshima bomb produced an explosion of 15 kilotons for 15000 tons worth of tnt the bomb dropped on nagasaki had an explosion of 21 kilotons but how much bigger can you clear weapons possibly get the answer is terrifyingly much much bigger the largest nuclear weapon currently in the united states arsenal is the b83 which can produce a blast of 12 megatons to understand the scale from here out one megaton is equal to 1 million tons of tnt and that is equal to 1000 kilotons remember that the hiroshima blast was just 15 kilotons so that means that the b83 produces a blast 80 times more powerful than that what ive been showing on this scale is only the size of the mushroom cloud that the bombs produced so to further add to the scale were going to place the size of mount everest here and the average altitude of a commercial airliner that you would normally fly on here so the castle bravo bomb is the largest nuclear weapon ever tested by the united states it produced a blast of 15 megatons or about 1000 times the scale of her oshima but even that pales in comparison to the largest nuclear weapon ever detonated in october 1961 the soviet union created the largest manmade explosion ever in human history when they detonated this device known as the tsar bomba here over this territory known as novaya zemlya the bomb detonated with an astounding force of 50 megatons or about 3333 hiroshima blasts it was so powerful that it almost destroyed the plane that dropped it shattered windows as far away as norway and finland and the shockwaves created by the bomb circled the entire earth three times but this test was actually just a scaleddown version of what was theoretically possible although never tested the soviets did have plans to create a bomb that would be twice as powerful as even the tsar bomba a bomb so powerful that it would have produced a mindboggling 100 megaton blast or about 6666 hiroshima blasts all together to get another sense of scale lets imagine that times square in new york city would be the epicenter of these blasts you can test this stuff out yourself on the website nuke map after watching this video ill provide a link for it after the end but lets see the results first first off were going to show the size of this detonation which was caused by the recent north korean test in 2013 following this heres the size of the hiroshima detonation which isnt really that much bigger but lets move on to the b83 bomb that we were talking about as you can see it would affect a much larger area than the hiroshima bomb but moving on past that to the castle bravo test we can see how it truly dwarfs everything before it but even that blast is incredibly tiny when we move on towards the tsar bomba as seen here and then finally for our scale we move on to how large the blast from the theoretical 100megaton version of the tsar bomba would be the blast would be so powerful this is what the blast radius would look like if you were observing it from the international space station so the question then becomes should any of this really worry you how many nuclear weapons exist today anyway well in total there are estimated to be around fifteen thousand six hundred nuclear weapons in the world currently enough to destroy the entire planet dozens of times over but only nine countries control that stockpile and 92 percent of those weapons are controlled by only the united states and russia the other eight percent of the global nuclear arsenal is controlled in descending order of numbers by france china the united kingdom pakistan india israel and north korea israel is however highly secretive about its nuclear program and has never publicly confirmed nor denied the existence of their news its just one of those things where everybody knows that they have them but nobody really comes out and says so unless your name happens to be mordechai vanunu a man who did reveal details about israels nuclear program and spent 18 years in prison including over 11 years in solitary fineman also interesting to note south africa used to be in possession of six nuclear weapons because the past apartheid regime was afraid of the 79 percent of the population that could in vote in communists trying to overthrow their government but they eventually agreed to dismantle all of them which make south africa the only country to ever acquire nuclear weapons and then voluntarily get rid of them well unless you dont count ukraine belarus or kazakhstan which all had nuclear weapons for a brief amount of time after they declared their independence from the soviet union in 1991 ukraine is particularly awkward because after their independence they found themselves in possession of over 5000 nuclear weapons which would make ukraine for a brief period the worlds third largest nuclear power and probably one of the most powerful countries on earth as a result they agreed to hand them all over to russia in exchange for a super serious promise that nobody would violate their territory or borders in the future and we all know how that turned out as a result of that happening its doubtful that other countries would be thrilled to ever give up their nuclear weapons in the future but leave your thoughts and comments below about how you feel one way or the other

__label__1 so a number of you left comments on our recent video introducing amds thread ripper 229 90 wx cpu about the overlay on the bottom right corner of my screen prompting me to activate windows now some of you were amused and some of you were upset but you all had one thing in common you couldnt imagine why an organization like linus media group one with sponsors like why an organization like linus media group with sponsors like that would need to save a hundred bucks here and there on a legit copy of windows well why dont we talk about that music so lets begin by grabbing a windows license out of the pile preferably one that isnt in use by dennis so by the way i got these at ncix so i clearly didnt just run out and buy them for the purpose of making this video so this would be the official procedure for installing windows on a pc in this case its my personal test bench the one that i usually have in my office here now im basically going to be burning this license for the purpose of creating this video which kind of sucks cuz its actually a so windows 10 pro license but its important for me to demonstrate my point here to show you guys actually activating windows and how that might work on the test bench and hey there we go activation windows 10 pro windows is activated with a digital license now lets say that i was working on something like a video card review so typically what we do in those cases is we get our pile of graphics cards ready here then after weve run our benchmarks on one card we shut down the system and swap out to a new one theres only one small problem with that microsofts activation servers create a unique identifier for your pc based on the hardware thats installed in it so you can see we actually survived one graphic card swap here but if too many things changed lets say you keep swapping graphics cards you want to see how the system runs with half as much memory you change out the cpu or worst of all you need to change out the motherboard either to try a different platform or as a troubleshooting measure what can happen is that identifiers can change and i dont fully understand exactly how it determines when it changes but if it does it can prompt windows to deactivate so we had checked this before we started and it wasnt activated yet so thats thats pretty funny because on this one i had even gone as far as to swap out the boot drive i was using but it still managed to grab something about the hardware id and managed to migrate the license but the point is that at some point you will get that prompt back now in the olden days and i guess this was probably about seven eight years ago the solution to getting an activation prompt was to call up microsofts activation hotline try the automated reactivation process have that error out twice so this is like a tenminute project then press a button to be put through to a representative explain that you had changed out some of your hardware and you needed a reset on your license but this was timeconsuming and it wasnt even a sure thing i actually remember getting into a fairly heated argument with a rep who was telling me that i had run out of reactivations and for my use case which is swapping hardware out all the time in order to test it i had to just buy a new license every time i got prompted with that activate windows watermark and i mean she said there was nothing she could do and then at some point i was it was a pretty awkward conversation but but but my point is even if she was right according to microsofts terms for the license im also right  i cant be expected to run out and buy a new license for windows every time theres some new hardware launch and ive got to do something with my test bench fortunately around that time i got a subscription to tech net a software subscription service that allowed you to use pretty much any microsoft software in a noncommercial environment with unlimited activations now that actually worked great for me even though technically my use was commercial since it was a forprofit endeavor that i was doing this testing at least it was great until they shut down tech net in 2013 now the new legit way to transfer your license is the activation troubleshooter so you can see what ive done now is i just linked my digital license to a micro to count so ive never done this before but theoretically what happens here is we should be able to even swap the drive and go into that settings menu and migrate the license to another computer on our own which is pretty cool and a lot better than the old system so lets give that a shot shall we so were not gonna get to show you guys exactly how it works because the microsoft activation servers work in mysterious ways but overall it sounds pretty painless theres supposed to be a prompt transferring your license blah blah blah blah etc something along yep they dont have any screenshots either anyway eventually no matter how youre moving your license around their terms do state that you will run out of activations at some point but with that said through this method and then you know maybe some of those cheap 20 windows keys that you can get from grey market sources online there should be no justification then for having that activate windows watermark right like we should just we should just bite the bullet and go through this process except for one problem those 20 keys that you buy online are not intended for the north american or the european market and they are therefore not actually legit so if having the watermark removed from your system is where you draw the line and thats what helps you sleep at night then thats great but the thing about software is that the license terms are defined by the eula that they read this first stuff not by whether a key activates or doesnt activate with microsofts servers for example the windows 10 vm that i have set up for remote access for one of our offsite workers is technically against microsofts license terms yeah i actually found that out just yesterday while i was prepping this video regular windows 10 is technically not allowed to be used exclusively for remote access the more you know write in much the same way if youve got a buddy whos got a volume license agreement or a site key thats not legit either itll activate for you and itll get rid of the watermark but that is still software piracy so at the end of the day there are inexpensive and even free ways for us to make sure that that watermark never shows up in one of our videos again but they involve either gray market software or violation of the license terms anyway so for a use case thats unsupported anyhow our whole thing where were using test benches to validate hardware the best solution that weve actually found is just to leave the software unactivated forever so heres the regular installer and you might not have ever noticed this before but microsoft actually has a builtin way to run windows for testing purposes so check out this button here depending on the version of windows the amount of time that youre allowed differs but if all we do is click skip instead of entering a product key the windows installation will proceed exactly the way that it normally would we still get windows updates performance of our hardware isnt impacted whatsoever we dont have to waste time tooling around with any activation nonsense and for my part honestly i sleep just fine at night knowing that my pile of windows keys downstairs more than covers the test benches that we have deployed so if you ever see our activation watermark in one of our videos again you will understand why im just avoiding some paperwork it has nothing to do with saving a buck on windows 10

__label__1 for the first time ever the united states uses powerful nonnuclear bomb from its arsenal thats right the us military drop what it calls the mother of all bombs on a tunnel networks eastern afghanistan although the gbu 43 is officially called the massive ordnance air blast bomb it picked up the nickname mother of all bombs due to its abbreviation and its giant size but what is this seemingly new weapon and is it really nearly as powerful as a nuclear bomb we thought wed take a closer look at the specs of the moab in this episode of the infographic show the massive ordnance air blast bomb developed by albert ly morts jr in 2002 the mall app was very nearly used in an attempt to take out saddam hussein the then dictator of iraq but us generals at the time were concerned that it would inadvertently hurt or kill civilians and they ultimately decided against its use since 2003 fifteen moabs have been manufactured according to the engineers who design them the bomb weighs approximately twenty two thousand six hundred pounds is around thirty feet in length and has a diameter of about forty inches most importantly however it has an explosive yield of 11 tons of tnt or 46 billion joules the surviving us candies were relatively close to the blast site describe the effects of the bomb as feeling like the heavens were falling this should come as no surprise since the explosive energy released by a moab is roughly the same as that unleashed during an m 60 earthquake the dye nation itself is caused by a mixture of tnt and aluminum powder which is a highly explosive mixture known as tritonal the addition of aluminum helps the tnt ignite and reach an extremely high pressure far quicker than tnt would be able to do alone guided to the ground by gps after being literally pulled out of a massive c130 cargo aircraft by parachute the moab doesnt detonate upon impact instead it explodes in the air above its target at a height of about six feet the bomb is so destructive that it has an actual bomb blast radius of one mile from the epicenter of litter ating anything and everything in it these death dealers dont come cheap however each mo app costs approximately 170000 with some experts suggesting that research and development for the bomb cost as much as 300 million dollars a little known fact about the mob is that it was originally painted green because the military was in such a rush to get the weapon into their inventory in 2003 and the only color available in the amount they needed was john deere green and finally for those who feel assured that at least the bomb is in american hands we have bad news for you russia has its own version called rather predictably the father of all bombs and apparently its four times as powerful as the moment no wonder vladimir putin horseback rides around town topless as if he doesnt have a care in the world a seed bomb mother russia so do you think the us military was justified and dropping them all out let us know in the comments and if you want to see an actual mole of exploding follow this link to our other channel the military show for some very exciting footage of this and other military wonders

__label__1 if you were just dropped in this place with no prior knowledge where would you guess you were maybe florida or california or hawaii somewhere tropical but this is definitely the us it just looks like the us from the style of signs to the way the roads look to the stores that line the streets you can tell its the us but its not florida its not california its not hawaii its not even on this side of the world its americas most isolated territory its guam the united states has five inhabited territories the us virgin islands puerto rico american samoa the northern mariana islands and guam itself qualm is the farthest of these five from the continental us nearly eight thousand miles away from washington dc making it the most isolated beijing deli cape town and buenos aires are all closer to dc than guam is and yet the island is a fully fledged territory of the us it is the us qualm has been inhabited for thousands of years by the native chamorro people until the 1500s when it was first claimed as a territory by spain centuries later after the usas victory in the spanishamerican war the territory was ceded to the united states along with puerto rico and the philippines aside from a brief and brutal japanese occupation during world war two the island has remained part of the us ever since many americans had never even heard of guam until summer 2017 that was when north korean leader kim jongun threatened to launch a ballistic missile at guam the threats may have sent subsided but the effects of that summer have not the island stretches less than 30 miles from top to bottom which makes it smaller than every other us state and territory and yet it packs more than a hundred and sixty thousand people into that small size in fact its more densely populated than all but five us states or territories meanwhile it is by far the most developed place in micronesia to put it in perspective juans neighboring islands the northern mariana islands which are also part of the us have a gdp per capita of 16800 while guams is more than 35000 kiribati meanwhile the most populous country in micronesia has a gdp per capita of 1500 guam is now post of the modern developed world in one of the poorest regions of the world its location though is its greatest assets its economy exists because of where it is the island is three hours from tokyo four hours from seoul and five hours from hongkong its close to asia but it is still the us unequivocally you see american license plates americanstyle ambulances they have us post offices they use the us dollar they have american stores american hotels us national parks us airlines there is no compromise on the american assam because it is the us they fly the us flag and for tourists this is a draw instead of flying seven hours to hawaii or 10 hours to california japanese tourists can and do just fly three hours to guam in order to visit the us the malls which look identical to any in virginia or kansas or anywhere else in the us are hugely popular with asian tourists as they can buy american goods for a fraction of what they would cost in asia about 15 million people visit the island of a hundred and sixty thousand each year but whats not good for tourism is missile threats last summer when they were playing whos whose missiles bigger we were the ones that suffered you go our tourism took huge nosedive that month of august we never saw so many news agencies come into guam and people from countries that didnt even realize we existed because all of a sudden kim jongun was threatening the american territory in the pacific this is benjamin cruz speaker of the guam legislature as he said the islands economy suffered immensely from the north korean missile threat many visitors of guam come as part of school groups or corporate retreats and these groups in particular almost universally canceled their trips we lost i mean almost our entire i mean probably japan stopped coming i mean everybody was afraid to come the only ones that were coming were the news me the news media fortunately the effects were partially mitigated by an increase in visitors from south korea who were less worried about missile threats since its a reality they live with every day back home but for an island so centered around tourism being dragged into politics is never good despite being part of the us though guam functions politically differently from every other part of the us benjamin cruz along with the 14 other senators are the lawmakers of guam they can legislate just like any state legislator but the main political difference for guam is at the federal level all the us federal laws the ones made in washington for the whole country all those laws apply in guam what guam doesnt get though is a vote their congressional representatives dont get a vote so by extension the people of guam cant vote on the laws that apply to them in addition unlike washington dc which also doesnt receive a vote in congress guam along with the other us territories is not able to vote for their president the us president this presents an issue not only because of the lapse in democracy but also because many us laws that may make sense for the continental united states just dont for a territory on the other side of the world wed like to be able to invite people to the island and industries that and not have to worry about whether or not the sec would approve it or the fcc would approve it wed like to be able to have control over our skies so we can invite airlines to fly in without having to clear with faa on whether or not this airline of that airline can or cannot fly the process for a foreign airline of gaining approval to fly to the us is often long and laborious and there are a number of special security and immigration rules for flights the us this isnt a problem for large intercontinental airlines or mexican or canadian wines for whom flights the us represent a large part of their market but for small regional asian carriers they might pass on flights to guam just to avoid having to gain fa approval another issue for guam is the jones act this law prevents foreignbuilt owned or operated ships from carrying cargo or passengers between us ports this may make sense within the continental united states just as you wouldnt want a foreign airline flying domestic cargo routes you wouldnt want a foreign shipping company taking over cargo routes like houston at a charleston or seattle to oakland but guam is a different story cargo ships generally make many stops along their routes so wed be perfectly normal for a taiwanese ship for example to go from oakland to hawaii took guam to a saka to taipei but it cant because then itd be transporting goods between us ports instead only us ships can bring goods from the us where most of guams goods come from to wong other us territories like american samoa and the northern mariana islands are exempt from this rule but guam is still subject to it which makes shipping to the island more expensive despite the issues the us federal government may cause the people of guam are in no hurry to distance themselves from it i think if you were to ask a majority of the people of the on the island they would like to have a closer union with the united states and someway even want statehood i mean in fact a majority of them would would love to see statehood in many ways guam is one of the most patriotic areas of the us the us military free guam from a brutal and deadly japanese occupation during world war two which many of the older residents still remember the younger residents meanwhile quite often work for the us just about every family on this island im sure almost every family on this island had at least one member of their family served in the military one out of eight residents of guam serve or have served in the us armed forces it has a higher enlistment rate than any us state but this is held by the fact that 14 of the island is us military bases the island is one of the us militarys most strategic assets of course the us has plenty of bases in japan and south korea but guam is us soil less than four hours away from north korea the east china sea and the south china sea all possible flash points for us conflict the us military is the single largest employer on guam and his economy depends on the military while tourism may have suffered recently the military business is good the number of military personnel stationed on guam is slated to more than double in the coming decade which will no doubt stimulate the economy this doesnt come without concern guam only has so much land but all factors considered guam is on the rise guam is truly a unique place plenty of countries have territories far away from their mainland but few are as developed and similar to the rest of the country as wang if guam was just off the coast of the us mainland it would be totally unremarkable just another piece of the us that looks and acts like the rest of the us but its not its on the other side of the world qualms is a relic of colonialism that today is a thriving developed place it may not get treated like the us even by its own government but in all other ways guam is the united states one aspect of guam story that this video didnt cover is how theyre trying to grow their local small businesses in order to make the economy more selfsustaining

__label__1 after months of delays and tens of millions of devices shipped by their competitors apples late entrant to the home smart speaker game has finally arrived but can it possibly compete with the google home max i speak her twice sighs armed with the almighty google assistant yes but its also a little more complicated than that despite some peoples observations that it looks kind of like a giant toilet paper roll subjectively i would still say that the home pod wins on the design front the seamless 3d mesh fabric looks great from any angle though i would recommend washing your hands before you touch it the capacitive glass top is an elegant haptic and visual interface displaying volume buttons when youre playing music and a beautiful listening animation when youre talking to siri and we even found the physical interface more pleasing to use tapping or holding volume buttons feels more intuitive than the slide gesture you have to do on the google home macs and its nice to be able to hale siri without using your voice a feature that google removed from all of its home devices wrong now the home pod is small but dont let that fool you its much heavier than it looks at fiveandahalf pounds and this is thanks to the incredible amount of hardware that apple packed inside it its got a four inch subwoofer at the top six microphones around the middle and seven tweeters at the bottom and not just regular tweeters these are really cool for one thing they are horn loaded which allows them to more efficiently turn mechanical energy into acoustic energy increasing their effective radiating area and making them sound bigger than they are and for another their diaphragms are balanced mode radiators meaning that they can produce high frequencies by rippling or low frequencies by moving the diaphragm in and out the oldfashioned way so if the home pod senses that the bass demands will make the subwoofer distort it will actually offload work to the tweeters and there is more to this technology than just using good speakers both home pod and google home macs use special low frequency calibration microphones to give themselves spatial awareness this functionality does allow these devices to map the room around them and then apply automatic bass correction to increase clarity now apple said in their keynote that the home pod would direct certain musical assets like the main vocals to the center of the room and ambient sounds and backup vocals to the side which is really good news because otherwise an omnidirectional wired speaker would not be ideal a lot of the time so i guess its all of that stuff combined that made this thing take so darn long and also what allow the home pod to avoid distortion even when its turned way up so the rumors are true it sounds really really good especially for its size but what about the elephant in the room the google home max from our evaluation it actually sounded just as good but with a different sound signature while the home pod has pronounced mids and highs that are very forward max offers a wider soundstage with deeper chestbumping bass thanks no doubt to its dual four and a half inch high excursion subwoofers although this is interesting while max gets significantly louder before it starts to compromise on sound quality at lower volumes the home pod can actually deliver surprisingly strong and pleasing bass compared to the max do we think to its ability to transfer sound down into the surface its resting on okay then so they both sound great but these arent just speakers theyre smart speakers which brings us to the next question we have to answer which one is smarter while both assistants offer the usual fairweather stock prices news we were disappointed to learn that unlike her competitors siri on home pod doesnt search the web so while she can rely on native api hooks to answer questions like who is the president of friends the answer i found is emmanuel macron at this time she stumbles on novel queries like how long is the average ferret i cant get the answer to that on home pawed ferret typically has a length of 15 inches its very geebo of you siri sad although your mileage may vary since some people have reported it working but while thats a clear disadvantage today the two devices are about equal when it comes to response time latency and their ability to hear your commands over loud music and home pod does have one awesome feature that google home doesnt have yet siri send a text message what do you want to say with that said home pod does not have voice recognition profiles like google home does so in theory anyone could ask your home pod to read out your last text message whenever they want i found your most recent message from edsel hey fire buns last night was amazing speaking of privacy while both devices allow you to turn off the microphones max is the only one that lets you do it with a physical switch so which one should you buy then we actually think the answer is pretty simple and comes down to whether or not you use apple music see with a google home or amazon echo you can use all the major music platforms spotify google play music pandora iheartradio you pretty much name it including apple music and the same goes for the home pod so why did we bring that up ah because its how you can interact with those services that makes all the difference here with google or amazon solution you get full voice control with everything but apple music which is limited to next song and pause with the google assistant and even then only if you are casting your entire device via bluetooth by contrast the home pod does feature voice control with apple music but only apple music so if youre using spotify the only way to control it even if you have an iphone will be through the buttons on your device and theres some more general inflexibility like weve come to expect from apple unlike the macs the home pod does not include a threeandahalf millimeter jack for thirdparty speakers and it requires an ios 11 device for its initial setup thats right android users and even those of you with older ios devices you will need to go buy an ipod touch on craigslist to get your home pod working well mostly working which brings us then to the features that apple promised that arent out yet and wont be until airplay two launches later on this year one the ability to connect multiple home pods in stereo and to multi room playback from airplay to devices be they home pods or apple tvs or whatever macs can do both of these things today so then that answer wasnt so simple after all but its okay i have a summary if you dont have any wooden tables and youre already deep into apples ecosystem with an apple music subscription and a bunch of money sunk into itunes home pod is a beautiful piece of hardware and a fantastic speaker but if you are almost literally anybody else youre probably better off with a competitive offering like a google home macs and a ly xa enabled sonos or even some regular dumb speakers plugged in to an echo dot hey siri tell me a joke music well this whole experience wasnt very funny at all this has been quite the project so far yeah i know hey siri read out my last text message i found your most recent message from edsel hey fire buns last night was amazing

__label__1 lets say theres a trolley and some tracks on those tracks are five mile the trolley is barreling down these tracks and you know with absolute certainty that it will hit those five men although there is a side track with one man on it in front of you is a switch if you push it the charlie will change directions and strike and kill the single man if you do nothing the trolley will strike and kill all five men what do you do do you play an active role but condemn the man on the left track to death or do you do nothing but allow five individuals to die this is a classic ethics thought experiment most people agree that they should divert the trolley and kill the one man it works for the greater good and mitigates risk now in a different scenario lets say youre standing on a bridge over the trolley tracks and once again theres a trolley barreling down towards five individuals on the track standing next to you as a man so fat that you know that if you were to push him on the tracks he would stop the trolley in its tracks and save the five individuals far fewer people say that they would push the man in this circumstance and say that they would divert the trolley in the first circumstance they are just not comfortable taking such an active role in the fat mans death these thought experiments are just hypotheticals and its unlikely that anyone would ever have to make those decisions however ethicists and developers are now having to create algorithms to dictate what our autonomous car to the future should do in similar ethical conundrums unlike humans selfdriving cars will have the ability to carefully choose their response to an oncoming collision and will need a set of pre designated rules to dictate what they should do in the event of an unavoidable collision one thought would just be to tell the cars to follow the laws the problem with this is that there arent really laws for these situations many laws are written concerning that ethics is a messy and fluid concept when judging a situation one can never really know what motivate an individual to choose a certain action but with selfdriving cars we will be able to understand the decision making process additionally following the laws could be harmful in some situations for example lets say a vehicle stopped at a traffic light and theres a pedestrian in the crosswalk directly in front of the car the car detects that a truck is coming in too fast from behind and will hit the car the car cannot move forward without hitting the pedestrian there are two options the car can do nothing stay put get hit by the truck and therefore hit the pedestrian in front or alternatively the car can move forward hit the pedestrian but avoid being hit by the truck from our perspective it probably seems right for the car to move and hit the pedestrian however this would mean that it was a car in your industry annow the truck this presents tricky legal and ethical questions on whether the car is now at fault for the injuries a pedestrian or if the truck is given the laws we have now its possible that the fault would be laid upon the car another question is who is at fault for an accident with a selfdriving car considering that there isnt a human driving is it the owner of the vehicles fault now lets say that the pedestrian was moving fast enough that you would no longer be in front of the car at the time of impact between the truck and the car but that in order for the car to move out of the path before the time of impact between the truck in the car it would need to have the pedestrian is it now ethical for the car to injure the pedestrian even though the pedestrian would likely escape injury if the car didnt move does it depend on the number of people in the car what if the car had a mother of three and the pedestrian was a felon would it be different if the car had a felon in it and the pedestrian was a mother of three thats where these ethical questions become even messier another school of thought is that the selfdriving cars should be programmed to save the most human lies or caused the least possible injury however there are issues with this solution as well lets think about another situation say there are two motorcycles coming down towards a selfdriving car on a road that is too narrow for the different vehicles to pass each other the car does not have enough time to slow down and there is no where to veer one motorcyclist has a helmet on and one does not should the car hit the motorcyclist with a helmet on because his injuries might be less severe or should the car hit the motorcyclist who does not have a helmet on because he did not properly protect himself if cars were programmed to hit the motorcyclists with the helmet that would mean that in a way it would become safer to ride without a helmet its a tricky situation altogether and a real ethical conundrum its very difficult for humans to explain or justify the rules behind our own ethics so thats why these questions are so difficult to answer for this reason a proposed solution to program selfdriving cars is moral modeling essentially programming by example the computer will be presented with a situation and a human or ideally an ethics board would tell the computer what the ethical solution would be over time the computer would learn how to emulate the ethics of a human and essentially make the same decisions that a human would make these are all situations that are very unlikely to happen but with how prevalent autonomous cars are likely become the algorithms that will determine how to crash could choose the fate of dozens of lives each year however autonomous cars are predicted to save upwards of 30000 lives per year once they are widespread these ethics may become a hotly contested issue in a few years however if these negotiations prevent or slow down the spread of driverless cars many more lives can be lost than would ever be determined by the socalled death algorithm whats easy you asked me to be nice at the end you write clean one way of looking at the ocean

__label__1 the richest country in the world is qatar which looks like this the second richest country is luxembourg which looks like this the third richest is singapore which looks like this the commonality between these three is that each of them has more than 90 percent of their population living in cities the three poorest countries the central african republic the democratic republic of the congo and burundi each have urbanization levels below 50 percent comparing the wealth of african countries and the urbanization levels of african countries the maps are nearly identical that is not to say that cities automatically create wealth or wealth automatically creates cities but there is a direct correlation between the two although it seems strange that humans would choose to live in cities living costs are higher air quality is worse surroundings are more crowded crime is more prevalent and disease is more easily spread if the population of the world spread itself out evenly every single person would have 5 acres to live on but we dont we live in a world where half the population lives on just 1 percent of the land 54 percent of the world population now lives in cities and thats significant 55 years ago only half that lived a city life the urbanization of the world is changing the world but why do cities even exist humans were originally huntergatherers they scavenge for food and often didnt live in a set place similar to how animals live but then in 10000 bc we learned to farm the domestication of plants allowed humans to finally settle down in one singular place and establish a longterm home but farming was nothing like it is today the humans of the era lacked technology and expertise the first archaeological evidence of ploughed fields a process that greatly improves crop yields doesnt appear until about 3000 bc it took thousands more years for farmers to successfully domesticate animals like the ox to pull a plow when humans first began farming nearly every individual had to farm order to make enough food to live one persons work essentially produced one persons food but through time as technological advancements occurred progressively each individual was able to make more and more food thanks to that farmers today each feed one hundred and fifty five people the process has also become so efficient that only one acre of land is now needed to feed one person but back in the early days of farming whence technology had advanced to the point where one person made more than one persons food for the first time ever there were some people who didnt need to farm and that fact changed humanity if that had never happened we would all still be living in ancient history the surplus of food and the development of cities really went hand in hand it had never before been possible for humans to live in dense urban conglomerations because they needed land to farm but these extra people freed from farming were able to work jobs other than farming which led to languages literature science and really all the technological advancements that made our modern world the spatial patterns of humans really happen quite naturally enough people are each making their decision on where to live that in aggregate humans are going to live in the best places to live theres a sort of process of natural selection that happens as billions of humans each pick their optimal place to live nothing is manufactured about where people live and numbers back this up you see cities tend to stay at the same rank throughout history in 1800 the largest city in europe was london today the largest city in europe is still london in 1800 the second largest city in europe was paris and it too remains second today cities grow but those that were large in the past tend to stay large at least without external influence cities dont just change ranking on their own they change rank if something else changes hong kong for example change drink when a change in sovereignty to british drew people in while with san francisco the discovery of natural resources particularly gold increased growth rates while with washington dc the coming of a new industry the us government changed the rank if you were to put a pause on all activity but humans moving rankings would hypothetically stay exactly the same but thats not even the best evidence for how natural the existence of cities is according to the us census bureau the largest city in the us is new york with 85 million urban residents then the second is los angeles with 4 million roughly half as many as new york then third is chicago with 27 million roughly a third and houston at 23 roughly a fourth than phoenix at 16 million roughly a fifth each city size is almost exactly determined by the largest cities size divided by a trank it is uncanny how closely city sizes in countries follow this distribution its not just with the us germanys largest city berlin has 35 million residents then hamburg has 18 million almost exactly half and munich has slightly more than a third at 14 million then cologne has just a bit more than a fourth at 1 million then frankfurt has almost exactly a fifth at 700000 now there are anomalies mostly countries with a recent rapid population growth but in a large number of countries the ranking of cities can be determined by this law but whats significant is what else can be determined with this law if you take a book and rank the frequency of words it follows this distribution if you take a stadium of people and rank them by income it follows this distribution if you take the sounds a dolphin makes and rank them by frequency it too follows this distribution the link between a distribution found in nature and the size of cities helps prove something cities are natural humans will given time and technological advancement always form into cities the existence of cities can really only happen when the pluses outweigh the minuses back before the food surplus there were few advantages to urbanized living and a huge disadvantage a commute to farming land during a time when walking was for most the only transportation method today the pluses have increased and keep increasing to the point where day by day more and more people live in cities a major advantage for the existence of cities is the ability for different businesses to low near each other part of the reason this is advantageous is that people come to cities to find jobs because all these businesses are there and so if businesses want to hire the best people to be the best they have to be in cities its a bit of a chicken and the egg problem but nowadays different cities tend to play host to different clusters of businesses for example la is a hub for the entertainment industry boston is a hub for medical research dusseldorf is a hub for the telecommunications industry and singapore is a hub for the finance industry in addition to the ability to tap into a common labor pool businesses cluster because they want easy access to other businesses telecommunications companies like vodafone deutsche telekom and att all exist as direct competitors in dusseldorf but the reason they are there is because other companies exist there as well that they can work with also in dusseldorf for companies like nokia google and lg which each make the phones that the mobile service providers might stock in their stores by all being in the same place they can more easily collaborate and therefore they can run their businesses more efficiently theres a sort of economies of scale effect when all sorts of companies are all packed together in one place now not every business is in a city because there are plenty of cases where the minuses outweigh the plusses you just wont see a car manufacturing plant in downtown manhattan because it doesnt make sense while there would be advantages such as access to a higher skilled labour pool proximity to other businesses and reduced transport costs by being closer to the final market there are significant disadvantages land costs about 38 per square foot in new york so if tesla for example wanted to move their factory to the city it would cost over 200 million dollars in land alone the benefits would never outweigh the costs and in fact it was this very problem that led to the decline of detroit the city was a major center of automobile manufacturing but eventually manufacturers figured out that they could greatly reduce cost by moving the plants out of the city without a major industry to employ individuals many moved away and the population has steadily declined for the last few decades cities exist because they are efficient nobodys forcing individuals to move to cities but billions have just imagine there were only ten people in existence and one product that each of them wanted to buy if they were all equally spread out across this plane the logical location for a distribution hub would be right in the center some individuals would happen to be close to the hub by chance but overall the product would have to be shipped a large distance to get to every consumer now lets say that eight of those ten individuals lived together in a mini city the logical location for the distribution hub would then be right by the city shipping for the rural individuals would be slow and expensive but overall the total shipping distance and cost to individuals would be lower you can see this concept with where amazon puts their warehouses in the uk they could have one enormous warehouse at the geographic center of the country and save money through economies of scale but they dont they position each of their warehouses near major population centers to reduce the total shipping distance in our modern context this concept is most easily demonstrated through shipping but historically individuals had to purchase nearly all their goods at physical marketplaces even just 200 years ago walking was the primary means of transportation in an hour nowadays we can drive 70 miles on an hour 200 years ago individuals could walk only three miles so the push to live closer to marketplaces was even higher this is why suburbanization is a new concept but still more individuals than ever choose to live in cities division and specialization of labor was crucial to the development of our world imagine you made everything you used you grew your food you gathered and filtered your water you built your own car just imagine how long it would take you to build a car from scratch at least a decade and yet the average individual in the us can buy a brand new car from the money that they earn in about six months thats because there are people better at making cars than you there are some people who focus solely on mining iron and then some individuals who focused solely on making glass and so there are thousands of people producing all the different inputs that go into making your car in the most efficient way possible lets say that you for example individually can make a pencil in 60 minutes and paper in 30 while another individual can make a pencil in 30 mm and paper in 60 in a closedoff world it would take each of you 90 minutes to make a pencil and paper but lets say you make two pieces of paper which would take you an hour and the other individual would make two pencils which would take them an hour and then you each trade neither of you have given up anything you get exactly what you would have gotten by working independently but you of each gained time this is exactly why trade is beneficial certain people are better at making certain things so by everyone specializing in what they are good at the entire world gets more without giving more cities make this trade easier which leads to more of it happening and therefore cities are efficient humans naturally want to find the path of least resistance and with our spatial patterns the path of least resistance is to all live together of course rural life will always exist and needs to exist but if you were to have a hand to pick up and organize every human into the most efficient pattern possible this is what it would look like cities dont create wealth and wealth doesnt create cities rather cities make wealth possible cities are efficient and efficiency creates wealth and so people create cities

__label__1 welcome to episode 2 of honest answers today im going to try to demystify another aspect of the inner workings of lynas media group about which there appears to be a lot of confusion how do we make enough money to afford all the staff studio space and equipment so it feels appropriate to open this discussion with one of the main ways that people think we make money paid advertising videos disguised as reviews while we actually couldnt be fined for that type of behavior here in canada where the advertising guidelines and even then they are guidelines not laws here are only just now being revised for the age of social and influencer marketing for brands and agencies that want to market to americans so forty to fifty percent of our audience hefty fines are quickly becoming commonplace with undisclosed influence or marketing so no responsible brand would engage in this practice and we outright refuse to as well anyway because even with proper disclosure what value does a paid review or even a video with a very similar structure to a review have to the viewer which getting into how we do make money then doesnt mean that we never do paid projects with hardware manufacturers we absolutely do every entry in the obscenely popular build guide series is clearly sponsored by either intel or by amd but in these and other product placement deals we retain the right for our hosts and writers to have their own opinions with very tight restrictions on what a brand can alter about the finished video we grant these sponsors no special rights to positive reviews in other videos or even space on our editorial calendar at all for example perennial sponsors corsair and coolermaster often promote products in preroll ads that we have never reviewed and a pacer as an example of a sponsor whose products we have never reviewed at all theres other baggage for lmg sponsors too we have on multiple occasions canned potential sponsors for refusing our terms and even existing sponsors for not taking care of our viewers dbrand is a golden example of what we expect in this regard if an ltte community member complains they mobilize the robot army immediately and do what it takes to fix it this is critically important for us because as im about to reveal in enough detail to make nick and yvonne wince no amount of marketing funding in the short term could possibly outweigh the longterm value of creating the best content we can while maintaining the trust and viewership of our audience im not going to give exact numbers here firstly because disclosing dollar amounts would violate some of our contractual agreements and secondly because exactly how much money i or luke or brandon or anyone else here makes is none of your fucking business but however much it is here is where it comes from a little under half of linus media groups revenue this year has come from sources that are basically directly affected by the number of views that we draw in youtube adsense you know that little skip ad button you clicked before watching this and amazon affiliate links that showed out at the end of our videos where you can buy the product that im reviewing or really anything else and we get a kickback makeup equal portions of this and vessel the early access platform where you can watch our videos seven days before they go live on youtube makes up a smaller but still very significant chunk of the remaining 50 in change a quarter of that is the brands who sponsor us to cover events like computex the samsung developer conference nab the polaris launch in macau and pax east another quarter of it is preroll ads and what we call standard product integrations you know how the mastercase 5 has a variety of modular parts and mass drop gets you great deals on genuine products over at draw duck slash etc etc and we baked those into our linus tech tips videos on youtube tech quickie and when show ads bots get separated out in our books so ill do the same for you they combined for just under 15 then another 5 is tshirt fan and hoodie sales another 2 is patrons and contributors and banner ads on the forum and point 1 is one sponsored spot that we did over on channel super fun for odious games men that channel loses a lot of money anyway though the remainder so just about a third of it is the dozen or so projects that weve done this year that fall outside of standard pre rolls and integrations some of them are dedicated disclosed fully sponsored videos like the recent tech then versus now video sponsored by sage the my grandpa meets google video sponsored by the google store and the unbilled logs that weve done with some system integrators including ibuypower and origin pc but many of them are things that probably wouldnt even occur to you on the books for this year weve got the sponsored instagram posts tweets and periscope streams that we did from the north america and new york auto shows with ford and toyota weve got a series of retail staff training videos that we produce exclusively for intels retail edge program weve got d brands product placement and sponsorship of scrapyard war season for logitechs daniel borel innovation center tour and nerd sports a series that vessel contracted us to produce as an exclusive web series for their platform with that being pretty much it so then why am i telling you all of this most youtubers keep this stuff very carefully hidden the answer is because i believe you guys have a right to know and because i hope that itll drive home once and for all why its in our best interest from both an ethical and even a monetary standpoint to make the best content we can make whether that means working with longterm partners products from non sponsors or even brands who cant be arsed to reply to an email about a review unit and i do all of this hoping even though i realize that no degree of transparency will convince some of you hoping that i can get across the point that we arent in fact actually paid nvidia shells nor are we obligated to bow to any other manufacturer all of these hardware vendors the ones on this list and any miscellaneous smaller ones i might have missed come find make up less than 15 of our revenue so far this year if that business went away tomorrow lynas media group would not only survive but it would continue operating the way it does without needing to cut anyones pay or downsize our workspace and this is thanks to the partnerships weve built with non hardware brands who want to reach our audience like squarespace dollar shave club king soylent gamma labs videoblocks blue apron tunnel bear and more and more importantly thanks to you guys you the audience are in black and white terms in every measurable way worth more to us than anything that a sponsor can offer and i hope that you can understand why that is now to be clear undisclosed paid reviews are out there im not saying to put away your tin foil hats just yet some key ways to recognize them would be manufacturer links especially tracked or custom ones in the video description with above the full being a dead giveaway or supporting social posts with weird hashtags that no one in the right mind would give a shit about but im just saying that thanks to cell flattery incoming careful planning on my part and my teams you wont find them here linus media groups integrity is not for sale it never will be and now you know why so

__label__1 music todays episode the moment has arrived not the moment per se but the systems have all arrived so we get to go through and look at exactly what came out of those cluster phone calls and evaluate both the packaging the shipping and of course the physical build unboxing experience so come along for the ride oh by the way alienware is going first disco cool okay ah no i actually dont have a knife on me yes so first up is delay lien were thanks alright so this is our alienware somethingorother ah here we go our alienware aurora system with one x mdot to nvme clearly these guys are new to retail packaging that is going to mean so much to the average consumer so dells total was 20 days from the time of ordering to the time of the system arriving and that is 20 real calendar days not 20 business days so about 23 of a month now the invoice they sent us was a really weird aspect of the aurora system because it was full of a bunch of like jargony things and there wasnt really we didnt have a clear idea of exactly what was coming or we wouldnt have if they hadnt walked us through it on the phone in terms of accessories did you know this thing comes with like nothing like look at this so we get a warranty safety and regulatory information pamphlet we get a quick start guide which basically says connect the keyboard and mouse which is not present if you see connect the network cable optional connect the display connect the power cable and press the power button ok and we get a power cable is that really it well did you try selling us a 10 keyboard and mouse i guess its better to not include it and not have to pay for it then to pay for stuff you dont need in terms of the quality of the packaging job that theyve done here theres already something that ive noticed yeah it is not a good thing to have a system loosely packed inside a box you want everything closed up as tightly as possible so theres still a fairly good chance that our system is just fine because at least dell is using a very high quality closed cell foam here so you can see that its its strong but its also not gonna crumble and crack if the whole box gets impacted by anything so that allows it to stay strong and it has some it has some give to it which is really important when its sitting you know vibrating on the back of a truck or whatever else i actually havent seen an aurora system in a very long time its got some heft to it thats probably as much to do with it being a steel case as anything else i guess we need a screwdriver hey screw me thats good all right i dont really have any complaints about the plastics i mean dells done a pretty good job of these kinds of things for a long time now get some of that peel action going on here oh interesting its perfect its perforated just in case youre like one of those horrible people who leads the plastic on your electronics its still gonna die thats awesome its like actually an idiot proofing measure cuz its the same thing here at the back  its all cheese grater that is freaking hilarious terms of io not bad usb 3 usb 31 type c another usb 3 osseo cant take headphone jacks for granted these days music there we go so our side panel does actually make use of the chassis intrusion detection so were probably going to get a notification about that theres our rgb pcb for the lighting in this sort of triangular do that they got going on here we actually cant see a lot about the internals of this machine so weve got a 120 millimeter cooling fan sucking air in from the front here weve got a very oh em great looking gtx 1060 thats with a rear blower design plastic shroud so its not like a like a high quality like founders edition metal shroud or anything like that but at this price point i wouldnt have expected that this is nice to see so weve got card support so even though there was some extra space in the box the chances of this card coming out of that slot or breaking it off ive seen that very slim i got a kick out of this yep a swing out i think so so i think you unlock these and then yeah oh thats kind of cool so all the cabling stays in place for our sata power our pci express all that good stuff and this gets us our first look at our motherboard so having reviewed a highend alienware desktop a little while ago back when am do you launch there thread ripper processor im not surprised by any of this but they are using a proprietary motherboard this is the ipc fl  sc its got that little alien silkscreened on it so this is definitely specific to alienware its got a mere four pin power connector for what ended up being a this is an 8700 k processor they want a faster remember ten times faster very important to remember that this is the exhilarating power to it and then this no this is gpu power oh so thats weird hey actually theres small weird stuff in here so look at this they use an adapter here instead of just plugging their 24pin connector directly into the board and i have to assume that its because theyre actually using a proprietary wire layout for this and you can you can actually see they are so orange drawings black red orange real ugly no black red black black red black grey purple yes wait white orange yeah but can yellow does might just be whites what is going on here what are you doing thats so weird what so just so you cant use a normal power supply we should find out if the system runs will help this plugged in because id be willing to bet that it does also notable down here is our nice robust thick cooling fan wow actually thats really nice on our aio cooler and our 120 millimeter radiators right up here in the top where its got clean access to exhaust theres actually this is a lot more open than it actually looks like so i would expect cooling on the system to be quite strong but check it out ds arnott cooled thats true and then as usual dells using just generic green pcb dems like you would get from all direct from micron overall i am less disappointed than i was expecting as long as you have compatible components and right now the motherboard and the power supply our big question marks this is a standard atx if motherboard standard atx power supply and it is easily user serviceable if you wanted to add a hard drive or whatever the case may be so the hp ordering experience was a little bit unique the invoice still didnt have a full spec list it looks like yeah it looks like it is actually written on the side of the box though so were gonna get a better idea of what were dealing with here very shortly but was what was really interesting as they put themselves at a disadvantage by canceling our order five days after we placed it and letting us know that the issue was that we used hangouts to call and so the number didnt match our credit card after we resolved it though the system was shipped the next day and so they still even with the five day head start that they gave everybody else still managed to deliver the gaming system to door ready to be gamed on first alright we get a keyboard a mouse i follow the packing job they do definitely gets extra points versus dell because while the quality of this material is slightly lower like its still a nice flexible foam rather than the brittle kind its packed in tight so once you close the flaps theres no room for it to move around one plug to push button so our final spec 8th gen core i7 8700 non k so its gonna be about onetenth the speed of the dell then 16 gigs ram 256 gig nvme ssd a 2 terabyte hard drive 2x2 wifi and holy crap hp is putting themselves in a pretty good position here to run away with this this is equipped with a gtx 1070 now the 1060 versus the 1070 is not a small step up that k series processor that dell upsold is going to have to have some serious performance benefits in order to outweigh the improvement in gpu that we get with our omen here thats nice carbonfiber replica actually im liking their industrial design a little bit better as well too so i dont know what the deal is with the os optical drive includes an optical drive did the dell even include an optical drive nope if were not making other compromises its better to have it than to not have it this is a really interesting window too theyve got like this really dark tinting on the window and i can actually just see through it i think were gonna get some nice illumination effects there you can also see theres a couple of little extra steps theyve taken with the chassis here so powder coating now powder coating doesnt cost a lot but you can tell hp spent the extra couple of bucks to make sure that even the back of their system which you wouldnt normally look at is all black including the power supply io is another strong point weve got an sd card reader to type cs and to taipeis along with our audio ooh the inside of the system looks a lot better too much more standard though so theres no swing out and gain access to key components for upgrades or anything like that and one place where hp is clearly behind dell here is the case cooling configuration and cpu cooling so rather than using a 120 millimeter exhaust to balance out the 120 millimeter intake at the front hp is just using a mere 92 millimeter exhaust and whats really weird about that is that it looks like it actually has space for a 120 mil here theyre using an adapter bracket so thats a case of kind of spending 30 cents to save a dollar from my experience because the 120 mil can doesnt cost that much more what if theyre going for positive case pressure on purpose thats possible but they could also just order a case fan with a lower rpm that would solve the same problem not weird hey mounting the adapter then mounting a 92 mm fan to it ive notice that their graphics card while still an hp specific sku goodnight an hp sticker here hp part number there these put a little bit of extra into making it more stylized so if you were to ever open up your case youve got this graphic on the shroud youve got this sort of like chromes geforce gtx logo here and it uses a matte black pcb which im always in favor of another interesting note is that the vrms again have nice big heat sinks on them and in this case its across all of them above and to the side of the cpu socket still 16 gigs of ram and bears are nvme see down there that looks like another hp specific model it starts with an m and ic sec somewhere in there so im guessing thats a samsung yeah its a samsung model of some sort and then theres our hard drive right there yeah check that out weve got hot swap cages here so you just well somehow presumably really you guys just slide it very cool thats nice here theres your easy upgrades this is just bonus dang hp this is a good omen but get it for the videos to come okay so this next either divert power yeah very funny okay yeah so cyber power they wouldnt recommend a system so they were booted from the running which means i know whos next its gonna be i by power now this box looks like it went through hell to get here this side really does look like someone gave it a good quality sidekick now did you notice that nobody asked us like what kind of case we wanted i dont think i actually had options door well normally isnt that kind of like i buy power and cyberpower stick well in this case guy actually found the best system for the budget and hed never really asked about stylist because she didnt specify either so the doubleedged sword of having such a wide variety of configs to offer your customers is that you have selection but the disadvantage is that its harder to make a cohesive package out of your systems so weve just got the box for the system in like a master carton that quite frankly probably isnt giving it a much better chance of arriving intact than if it was just shipped without it cuz assuming that the shipper adheres to the this side up sticker which you can see is right there then yes this is actually quite a firm sort of eggshell carton style foam and it would help with impact significantly but theres so much room for it to bang around from side to side and i mean come on weve all seen the videos lets see how our system did so we got as you see two gaming mouse and an aries ii one gaming keyboard with spill resistant structure youve got a customer service line we can call and a quick start guide well they already lied package includes a desktop tower and gaming keyboard gaming mouse nice high quality foam here though really soft but really strong so our modular clearly evga power supply that was included gets all the extra cables bundled up nicely for us and a handy resealable bag little touches like that make a difference when youre trying to upgrade your system three years down the line oh where do i put all that stuff so weve clearly gotten asus graphics card msi motherboard evga power supply theyre all gonna be brands that you recognize again this is one of the challenges with having any number of different case designs is you cant have custom packaging and you cant have custom brackets to hold everything together in shipping so what theyve done is theyve included this foam packaging material inside to prevent your system from getting damaged in shipping youll also notice that these instructions are for this like ancient i think thats a raid maxx case from like 15 years ago yeah they dont correspond to the way that you would actually open this chassis it doesnt have screws at the back and you dont need a screw driver thats something that i really think they could do a better job of for new users to their credit though we actually looked into using these at ncix in the past and i had wanted to do it like if i recall correctly these cost a couple bucks each for 50 there you go so that adds a significant amount to the cost of a system but its all about getting it there in one piece for the buyer wow that is a very barebones looking system compared to our our hp omen there so just like our alien where weve got better cooling for the cpu but weve compromised on our cooling floor of the cpus vrm which may or may not matter because what cpu is actually even in here this is actually a 9600 i 9600 will check whether its kilo note and a member they sold it to us before it was launched so were honor ordered it that would probably explain why even though this is a fairly simple build they still took what about 20 days to deliver the final system now the thing is what happened in the middle is that the psu were usually ordered was out of stock so they gave us a free upgrade with a 750 grammes really yeah thats pretty good speaking of the power supply theyve done a better job at the back of making sure that you use the correct video port so alienware had onboard video but didnt specify in their quickstart guide where you should plug your monitor into these guys say hey dont plug it in here and theyve got a sticker on the back to make sure that you dont plug in your system and run it before you remove the foam insert because ive talked to sis before its like a big problem people just turning the system on and letting it cook foam taking up the entire inside in spite of the kind of bareness looking of it its obviously modular and easily upgradable because it uses all standard offtheshelf components and theyre all free quality brands that i would trust so weve got msi motherboard a zeus gtx 1070 graphics card to go with that 9 series cpu a day to ram looks like 16 gigs of it corsair liquid cooler evga power supply and weve got a toshiba one terabyte drive for the back this thing is gonna shred when it comes to gaming performance and a processor is the cake the only drawback here is gonna be that this is a sata ssd rather than an nvme ssd and that might affect system responsiveness but from my experience not much i buy power is looking pretty good here yeah thats a pretty poor application of that sticker yeah they could have put a little more effort into that i think it was origin before main gear right yes its origin okay so far the unboxing experience feels pretty special but based on what im expecting about the specs of this machine it had better be really special so they include what seems like a reasonable quality mouse mat thats kind of nice to see did they ask for shirt size yeah you get to pick you told them xl oh janice thanks janice so they actually benchmark the system somewhat since in the bench yeah so theyre assembled on one day qa the next burning and ship on the third day the interesting 450 watt silverstone power supply again recognizable brand names and the sy motherboard and this is interesting its a core i5 8400 so what happened here was weve got an 8400 which they up sold us telling us it would be a lot better which of course it would be but it didnt technically fit in our budget so we resolved to benchmark this system both ways with what they up sold us and with what they would have originally shipped and honestly given that it they did send it with a gtx 1050 ti im not expecting it to improve much remember this is a 1500 us dollar system and this poster and what else you got over there scums team code a star trek vanguard starter pack and shroud of the avatar steam code along with call of duty black ops for still these better be some amazing games on that 1050 ti very high quality foam credit to them for that and it was all packed tightly within the outer box and credit to origin there chronos is a sexy little machine a sexy little machine that probably should have had some plastic filled stuff on the front see that oh boy origin pc the thing with someone like origin is that we are paying a fair bit extra for the custom chassis and it has some cool features of the kronos which weve actually featured before has these magnetic feet as well you got to do is move them and then you can have it in a tower configuration or a desktop configuration and it is extremely compact so this is the smallest of the systems that weve looked at today it looks like it has managed to stay in position and because theyre using a pci express riser to install the graphics card it doesnt seem to have come out yet but given enough time this would cause a problem please tell me at least have 16 gigs around all right so cooling weve got an 80 ml on the front that goes directly over these perforated two and a half inch cages for our solidstate drive remember that is a mere 120 gig solidstate drive quality components you got a silverstone sfx power supply here eeda graphics msi motherboard kingston or hyperx memory with origin cobranding on it so this is again your motherboard accessories your power cord your extra power supply cables and any documentation that came with your parts also they throw in a usb drive thats actually they recover a usb i believe okay thats a nice touch that is a nice touch and its 16 gigs and then youve got their own a io cooler its an asa tech based unit though so it sits just fine to me the big disappointment was that our unboxing experience was marred by these these handprints on our system and that it seems like origen gave up a lot to have their custom chassis with their fancy motherboard and ended up with a bit of a miss spect system like i would i wouldnt recommend this to someone whos purely after gaming performance this brings us finally to main gear pc these guys were also right in that funniest day range and they did a really excellent job of keeping us updated on the status of our order throughout so after placing the order they said hey you know weve got your order hey now your systems being kitted you know heres all the parts that are picked hey its assembled hey its shipped and bippity boppity heres our system so right now this is kind of main gears competition to lose because they definitely did the best job of the presales experience and honestly so far the packaging and feeling pretty good about as well as is a nice high quality phone its all packs nice and snugly within the outer carton and theres a second internal carton i think the odds of this getting damaged in shipping a quite slim okay more solid packing materials really nice phone wow these guys go all out so they have also invested the what do you say it was about four dollars into foaming up the inside of the system its dangerous to go alone take this cute you can tell they actually use the actual system that i mean not the exact one but the same configuration for their startup guide also in here our invoice windows recovery documents and accessories resealable very nice thats another board table case screws in case you have any want to upgrade and you got a pen and some sticker the keychain coaster id say thats a bminus mousepad it doesnt have a stitched edge so its gonna frame more than the other one you can see plus they write you a little note on the inside of your box enjoying yvonne alright before powering on you must first remove the packing foam inside your computer no real instructions on how to do it though thats something that i think i buy power for all the deficiencies in their instructions did a better job of making clear so this seems mostly designed to prevent the graphics card from moving around like clearly they dont think the radiators gonna come off or anything like that so our config in here is an interesting one weve got the best cooling for the cpu out of any of our systems here weve got an overclockable cpu so thats a rising 520 600 x weve got 16 gigs of ram nonexpandable unfortunately but then weve got a dt x 1060 intel ssd and then weve also got a seagate barracuda 1 terabyte drive for our games down in the bottom im expecting the system to perform decently but any points that main gear gained during the ordering process they are probably going to end up losing in gaming performance nothing against amd but this cpu is not going to perform as well as our intel based machines in that particular application and our gtx 1060 well lets just say we probably would have been better off spending our dual radiator money on a 1070 and putting a stock cooler on it maybe the benchmarks will tell the whole story so thats it then ordering process and initial impressions complete let us know in the comments below who you think is going to be coming out ahead and our secret shopper showdown next up is going to be customer support how do they handle it if the system doesnt work a hundred percent right out

__label__1 in the automotive world a sleeper is typically a slow car like say a toyota cressida that has been modified to be insanely fast and theres another key element the best sleepers like this one from mighty car mods feature no external modification so potential challengers would have no way of knowing that its capable of chopping them to shreds eating aforementioned shreds then pooping them out so inspired by this concept we grab the nastiest oldest your greatuncle is still using it for some reason case that we could find and vowed to make it smash gains once more meet hubert play named plain looks plain performance here you know that kind of plane music so first we needed a case and our good friends over at free geek hooked us up with this and an tech sx 840 which back in the day was pretty dope but after almost 15 years of filth collection well lets just say it was perfect opening it up though the insides actually could have been a lot worse all things considered i wonder if this thing has even been opened since shortly after it passed qc back in 2003 i really hate that thats a long time ago now anyway next order of business was a plan to pack it full of as much power and water cooling as we could and because alex cant resist an opportunity to fire up that copy of solidworks that they gave us for just such occasions we created a model of the case and started virtually testfitting our components radiator in the bottom with vent holes hmm well that could fit but then wed be stuck with a single graphics card unacceptable so we settled then on a thick triple radiator in the front this might seem slightly overkill but these new core i nine processors run hot as hell when overclocked and we wanted to be able to push up this baby as far as possible time to head down to the workshop we pulled the drives then spent about the next half an hour drilling out rivets with our trusty bottle of rapid tap ah thats better i mean who needs ancient mechanical drives when you can have more room for cooling time for a test fit then before we make any irreversible modifications our pump reservoir position was the trickiest to figure out at first we wanted it to go in the bottom but because of the pcie slot positioning on our asus prime x2 99 deluxe we couldnt make that work there is some room up top but that would make sealing the system more difficult without putting in a fill port in the top and ruining our beautiful sleeper aesthetic so finally we came up with an idea maybe we could mount it to the fan i mean sure thats not the greatest for airflow and it means that well have to be darn careful while drilling into them but it might be just crazy enough to work how to mount the radiator though holes in the front of the case would be the most obvious solution but stealing the top radiator mount from a master case pro5 would save us some time so we flattened it out a bit and often still about a half an inch too thick not a problem though its angle grinder man to the rescue so with the cuts tidied up it did still interfere slightly with the motherboard tray rivet so all those came with the drill and these holes here should serve us well for mounting the radiator of course though our troubles werent finished and we were still having some difficulty getting it in due to these pesky tabs thankfully almost every problem in life can be solved with abrasive much better to line up the screw holes we poked the drill through the existing holes and gave it a little spin just to remove some of the paint so we knew where to drill next we center punched where the screws would be and drilled on through we then poormans tapped them out with some thumb screws and a lot of love and holy crap this might actually work now since the reservoir cant go anywhere else we had to make some modifications to this poor fan so we started small then worked our way up to the super objects thats always the best way okay then awesome the reservoirs mounted but clearly well need more airflow angle grinder to the rescue again and as though like magic thats more like it so with hopefully all of our modifications to the case finished it was time to finish it off with a nice coat of black tape applause music so at this point we were ready to slap all the parts in plan out our water cooling loops and call it a day but then shortly after the cameras turned off for the night getting jiggy with it came on the radio and we realized the soft tubing wed planned wasnt big willy style so we flip the script and flip the red extended the res and devised the plan for a loop sexy and hard enough for even the biggest willies so instructions for hard line then measure cut fill heat bend check insert secure rinse and repeat until done oh custom hard line water cooling easy as that after several hours of cable management man old cases suck for that we were ready for the final touchups so we disassembled the loop installed the storage ram 80 millimeter og case fans which only got cleaned on the inside to maintain our sleepers perfect external fill and then reassembled the loop and filled it up music so that at this point he put back together the outside of the case front panel goes on with double side tape cd and floppy drives the side panels go back on and would you look at that its still awful and dirty on the outside leaving anyone without a very keen eye to dismiss it as old crap but open it up and holy frig is it beautiful and with the horses to back it up with an intel core i 970 900 x10 core 64 gigs of ram rgb of course dual geforce gtx 1080 s samsung 940 pro ssd in a fully custom water cooling loop we are looking at a machine that can run with pretty much anything out there today while saying both cool and quiet that is if you disable the rear fan because theyre really really loud ow so thats in the glory now of hubert and stay tuned for dale because the sleeper pc series is far from over music

__label__1 for months now graphics card supply has been completely tapped out thanks to every gamers worst enemy miners and no not young people who screech into the microphone but theyre awful too im talking about the kind of miners who are using hardware both pc components and more specialized equipment to calculate what are called hashes for crypto currencies like bitcoin in exchange for a reward effectively mining for money but how do you get in on the action can you just fire up your old pc and start making money lets investigate lets get this out of the way first to make a gold rush analogy the days of walking on to a random plot of land you know sticking your pickaxe scissors or whatever into the nearest mountainside and sailing home in a golden ship are basically over but just because mining the most popular cryptocurrency bitcoin is no longer practical for the average person with a an extra graphics card or two that doesnt mean that you cant mind for something so as always around here we started our adventure with some overkill hardware bringing our 10 gpu server out of mothballs up from 8 gamers one cpu theoretically 1080p eyes are the most profitable but we have to ignore cost to buy what do you mean ignore classes to buy what do you think im like native graphics card sneezies so then what we ended up with is 5 dt x 10 70s for gtx 10 80s and then a single 1080 ti its not gonna be like the highestearning rig but we can use this to run some important benchmarks and determine whether our plan will be profitable i guess we had to get upstairs one trip yeah sure i was about to say the same thing oh come on its just like complete disregard its fine who cares i care its just its fine like were just not gonna drop it so it doesnt matter right you got because you never drop anything ok here ok technically not the way its meant to be rolled i dont think but yolo we left it any higher so i got my ankles ok thank you oh dont shift it pat you know i think we actually could have said 11 in here if we used the katana i think it throttles a little bit i think might hang on the katana would be a terrible terrible idea saying i think we couldve well i do this jakes gonna work on installing the whopping two sticks of memory out of the 24 slots on our board here cryptocurrency mining doesnt really benefit from a ton of ram with that said though it may benefit from a large virtual memory space on your storage drive and then hes also gonna throw in two of our 22 core xeon processors wait i yes i know thats really stupid theyre just the only two cpus that we had lying around that were compatible with this board and we actually have to populate both of the sockets for this because otherwise we wont have enough pci express lanes for all of these freakin gpus are you struggling i dont have enough do you have any more this tickets less than four hours aha here and i was right oh its cuz hes here not because i had no confidence and youre doing this by yourself ouch and youre gonna drive up all of our insurance premiums when he has to go to the fuck emergency and get that inserted up and there we have it we are now ready to boot up our system actually almost cooling is sort of a concern in a system like this so were gonna go ahead and throw our fans back in here and then jake are you ready with that shroud just gotta get this gaff tape im stuck wouldnt want to be wasteful you know theres are you really reusing tape yeah this tape is still sticky how cheap do you think i am is this an yvonne initiative i mean this chassis clearly isnt designed to have graphics card um yeah i dont know how were gonna fit this in here off of it i think you kind of have to just cram the tip in between two of them like it was made to fit come on we used tape look its not sticky i told the gaff tape is amazing i never told me that okay well gaff tape is amazing so now we just need some power okay for right oh right yeah dori i planned for this we could have easily done this experiment with just a normal motherboard or 4g yeah but that wouldve been so lame its like power me please look im working on it okay please give me power im failing come on okay were in ready well good ah yes slightly less annoying where all the 62 degrees from right here music that was terminally unimpressive okay there we go thats more like it thats how you know its working okay so while were waiting to fire up windows and install the nvidia driver which by the way takes a longass time on a system with 10 gpus lets have a look at power consumption were looking at 400 watts right now 400 watts and i though at idle so basically no matter what kind of hardware youre using mining is gonna add a lot to your electrical bill so its this real cost thats associated with it that prevents casuals from just using old hardware to mine these days it is all about efficiency so our pascal based cards consume a similar amount of power compared to previous generations but they run the algorithms needed for mining much more quickly than previous generations and the more calculations that you can perform per watt of power consumed the more profitable youll be the other key is to mine smarter almost no one is mining for bitcoin directly these days because over time the difficulty of generating a reward by mining goes up a lot so people are opting instead to mined for an altcoin like litecoin aetherium z cache or even dogecoin yes for the uninitiated that was and is a real thing scratching the table oh my god that got a lot heavier im so happy im not carrying that side thats fine ill be on the bottom this time oh wait im going backwards again what the hell no you go backwards also i just locked this door wait my elbow needs to unlock it wait why are we standing like this this is not a good strategy yeah and you slide that way and ill slide this way yeah uhhuh i got it if we drop it if its not that big of a deal hold on dont push holding sort of counterintuitive other side is there it is yep really are you serious yeah holy that was painless so now that its installed the plan is to use a market place called nice hash that pairs buyers who want to rent hashing power with sellers who have hashing power like us so whats cool about that is that after you run the included benchmark which can actually take a few hours with this much gear and had trouble with the 88 threads worth of cpu that were rocking in this version of the software anyway it determines which algorithm is most profitable for which piece of your hardware at any given moment and runs that giving you a realtime readout of how much youre earning before electricity costs and then paying you out daily as long as your balance is at least point zero zero 1 of a bitcoin that is after taking their cut its booting right i think so okay so over the weekend jake i didnt really help spent a bunch of time babying this thing through crashes and blue screens and we have finally got it mining stabili tm we initially thought that the issues might be related to thermals because lets face it the cards are really close together by the way your ducting seems to be falling off if you want to go have a look at that get this letter in here what with afterburner up on screen its actually pretty clear that our climatecontrolled server room has that under control were hitting 82 degrees top some of them are a lot lower like 70 even but actually that reminds me we havent factored the cost of air conditioning into our profitability equation but thats something that we can really look into during part two of our investigation so getting back to this machine you might have noticed that there are actually only eight gpus in the system now see that we pulled out the middle  thats actually due to an nvidia driver limitation that specifies a maximum of eight gpus per operating system so shout out to gary over at asus for that tip so that means our final power usage is a cool 2000 watts no biggie then for our remember for power supplies lets talk about the return on our investment to buy that configuration would run you nearly 18 thousand us dollars at an average of eleven dollars a day in profit again not accounting for air conditioning it would take around four and a half years to recoup that and that is assuming stability in the cryptocurrency market stability what stability in the cryptocurrency market right what a joke so obviously this would be a really stupid mining setup to go out and buy however if you were a little more how you say not a complete idiot about your part selection assuming that your power costs are similar to ours at around 10 us cents per kilowatt you could actually get your upfront investment back a lot sooner so were gonna investigate a more optimized config in a follow up video but this config for about 5000 that youre looking at right now is kind of what were planning let us know if you have any suggestions in the comments first lets get back to the original question does what were doing make any sense well if you have a bunch of spare modern hardware lying around collecting dust actually yes so were planning to leave that system running until phase two when will report on our results and then compare it to our second system but if you have to go out and actually buy hardware to do it your return is likely going to take so long that youd be better off doing what many people are doing and trying to buy and sell crypto currencies more directly as they rise and fall though there are certainly risks associated with that as well so why did everyone run out and buy all the video cards and highwattage power supplies driving up prices for gamers well while the profit isnt anything earthshattering many miners actually resell their hardware when its no longer profitable recovering much of the upfront cost and then keeping all the money that was made while the systems were in service so let us know in the comments what you guys want to see in future follow ups here because we have hardly begun to explore this rabbit hole were planning a future build with 19 gpus in one system so thats gonna be a thing and wed love to talk about asics as well those are pretty interesting but we definitely want feedback from you guys and

__label__1 so this is a very special video for me because as im sure many of you already know i live in texas and have lived here for nearly my entire life so naturally ive always wondered what texas would be like if it was actually its own independent country it used to be one once for a quick point in history between 1836 and 1846 before it got annexed by the united states but what would this independent texas look like today if it ever happened first of all texas basically gets second place in everything inside the us it has the second largest population behind california the second largest economy also behind california and the second largest area behind alaska but that doesnt mean that texas is small the texan population stands at 28305000 people which would make it the 50th most populous country in the world ahead of a lot bigger countries like australia while texas is much smaller than australia in terms of land its much bigger than any country in europe is except for russia texas is so big on a european scale that you could fit all of poland inside of it and still have room to drive around the edges the town of texarkana in the east is closer to chicago illinois than to the city of el paso on the western side of texas if it was independent texas would be the 39th largest country in the world in terms of land area but the final big thing about texas is its economy the texan economy stands currently at a gdp of 1599 trillion us dollars this is enormous and would make texas the 11th largest economy in the world beating out other giant countries like south korea russia and australia again big companies like american airlines att dell and exxon mobil all have headquarters currently located in texas which dramatically adds to this economic power texas is probably one of the few us states that actually could succeed as an independent country and here are a few reasons why first it has a coast and therefore access to the worlds shipping routes houston is the 8th busiest port in the united states and already has shipping routes connected with brazil the netherlands germany india and china second texas is whats called a taxdonor state meaning that the texan state government sends more money to the federal government than it receives back in benefits for every one dollar that texas sends to washington it receives back just 94 cents this means that texas could fund all of their current government expenditures and still have enough left over to generate a nice budget surplus compared with other states like mississippi who gets three dollars back from the federal government for every one dollar they send texas would be in a great financial situation at first upon becoming independent the final reason texas would be selfsustainable is energy lets switch over to a map of the us electrical grid to see how thats the case there are only three main power grids in the mainland united states that the us operates the western grid the eastern grid and the texan grid texas has its own fully independent electrical grid that wouldnt be influenced by the rest of the us if another state like say new mexico decided to leave the rest of the us could just shut off that part of the grid and deny them electrical access not so with texas but heres the really interesting part back in 1840 texas used to be a lot bigger back then it claimed about half of modern new mexico and also chunks of oklahoma kansas colorado and even as far north as wyoming if for some reason the modern texas was expanded back to this territory today it wouldnt really add as much as you think the population would only go up by a little over 12 million people because besides the towns of santa fe in new mexico and pueblo in colorado most of this extra land is pretty rural but back in 1840 the entirety of texas was even more rural back then the entire population of texas was an incredible 70000 people basically the size of a small suburb of either dallas or houston is today the only settlements you can see on maps from back then were san antonio houston and santa fe which were all basically islands of people separated by hundreds or thousands of kilometers of open and unpopulated land texas has changed dramatically since then in just a little over one and a half centuries from a rural backwater on the fringes of the world to an economic powerhouse home to tens of millions but theres one more thing that we havent touched on yet and thats if texas could actually legally do this the answer is a definitive no the us government has made it explicitly clear that no states can ever leave the union since the last time that was tried didnt really go over so well this includes texas who can never ever hope to compete with the us military texas does have a pretty weird clause though in its consitution that allows the state to at any time divide itself into five different smaller states texas doesnt need permission from the us congress to do this and it would immediately quintuple their own power in the us senate from having two senators up to ten senators this could enable texas to influence the us government more heavily but likely wouldnt help it to achieve independence the vast majority of people living inside of texas dont want independence anyway but its always just fun to speculate the secession of texas is just one of the many themes of one of my alltime favorites games deus ex its about a grim future where humans can be technologically enhanced and where every conspiracy theory is more or less true

__label__1 nature is still the queen of our planet and one of the greatest displays of her raw power can be found in the form of hurricanes these huge and often disastrous storms are a well known fact of life to sailors and coastal communities the world over but these storms are called different ways depending on where you are in the atlantic and northeastern pacific they are hurricanes in the northwestern pacific they are typhoons while in the southpacific and indian oceans they are known as cyclones whatever name they go by they are nothing to take lightly but how large and how powerful can these storms actually get lets start explaining the saphirsimpson scale which youve probably already seen used it measures hurricanes on a scale between category 1 on the low end and category 5 on the high end to help you visualize what each level of the scale means lets begin with the smallest known cyclone ever on record tropical storm marco to be classified as a category 1 hurricane a storm needs to have wind speeds of at least 74 miles per hour 119 kilometers per hour and so since marco only had a maximum speed of 65 miles per hour 105 kilometers per hour it wouldnt even register on the scale the storm was about the same size as rhode island and the damage it caused when it impacted mexico was minimal but obviously actual hurricanes can get much nastier than this even on the low end at a category 1 storm hurricane nate in 2017 became the costliest natural disaster in the history of costa rica causing 787 million dollars in damage and claiming the lives of 48 people a category 1 storm has wind speeds ranging between 74 and 95 miles per hour 120153 kilometers per hour and nates max speed at 90 miles per hour 145 kilometers per hour easily made it make the mark but the further up the scale we go the more ferocious the wind speeds become at category 2 a hurricane must have wind speeds of between 96 and 110 miles per hour 154177 kilometers per hour this is fast enough to damage roofs and windows of homes uproots of trees and destroy mobile homes hurricane arthur is a recent example of this type which grew to about the size of montenegro once we reach category 3 these and all further storms are considered to be major hurricanes to be considered a category 3 a storm needs to have wind speeds between 111 and 129 miles per hour 178208 kilometers per hour even the most wellbuilt homes or office buildings can suffer minor damage against this while buildings without a solid foundation will probably be totally destroyed hurricane otto in 2016 was a good example of this type which grew to have a max wind speed of 115 miles per hour 185 kilometers per hour and became close in size to the netherlands hurricanes start getting extremely terrifying when they reach category 4 though the deadliest natural disaster in all of american history was because of a category 4 hurricane that struck the city of galveston in 1900 with wind speeds approaching a 145 miles per hour 233 kilometers per hour the hurricane basically destroyed the entire city and left somewhere between 6000 and 12000 people dead but thats nowhere near the deadliest cyclone in world history that unfortunate honor goes to the 1970 bhola cyclone that smashed into a place that used to be called east pakistan and now its called bangladesh the storm was about the size of albania and claimed the lives of over 500000 people more then all american fatalities during the second world war combined another horrible record set by a category 4 hurricane was by harvey in 2017 approaching the size of hungary it slammed into the coast of texas in 2017 and became the costliest hurricane in history causing about 125 billion dollars in damage which is also close to hungarys total gdp so you can maybe call harvey a hungary missile but that missiles record is technically tied with an even more ferocious storm back from 2005 katrina which became a monster close in size to poland with wind speeds of a 175 miles per hour 282 kilometers per hour it also caused a 125 billion dollars in damage and claimed the lives of over a 1000 people when it struck the southern us this is our first category 5 hurricane but there are many more that are significantly bigger as it stands now as of the making of this video hurricane florence as not yet made landfall in the carolinas but its looking like a true monster approaching the size of france hurricane patricia back in 1979 grew to about the size of the entire iberian peninsula spain and portugal combined and clocked in the highest wind speeds ever measured in a hurricane at a demonically fast 215 miles per hour 346 kilometers per hour thats fast enough to probably destroy most buildings that would ever come across but theres still a few who have grown even bigger well not as ferociously fast hurricane john was considerably bigger in size nearly the same as iran john holds the record for being the longest lasting hurricane at 31 days and the furthest distance traveled by one 11530 kilometers 7160 miles or about 29 of the way around the entire planet only a tiny handful of hurricanes have ever been bigger than this but one of them was sandy which became the biggest hurricane to ever strike the us it was about half the size of australia which looks horrific on a map by the east coast but with a wind speed of only a 115 miles per hour 185 kilometers per hour it was actually classified as just a category 3 storm so the damage it caused wasnt as bad as it couldve been if it had upgraded but by far the biggest and most terrifying storm on our planet is known to a have ever experienced was typhoon tip back in 1979 growing in the northwestern pacific tip reached a size comparable to the entire county of india and maintained windspeeds of a 190 miles per hour 305 kilometers per hour thankfully tip weakened before it eventually hit japan but imagine the damage it couldve caused if it had hit somewhere at its peak strength if the hungary missile caused a 125 billion dollars of damage in texas imagine what an india missile couldve done in japan but worst of all hurricanes are probably going to get bigger later during the century because of global warming the warmer the ocean water gets the stronger the hurricanes winds can become noah estimates that because of climate change hurricanes intensity will increase by 2 to 11 by 2100 which doesnt sound like a lot until you remember that 211 of wind speeds close to 200 miles per hour is close to 422 additional miles per hour 635 kilometers per hour which is fast enough over a speed limit to get you a ticket pretty much anywhere speed is important or at least the illusion of it is

__label__1 if you look up there are four thousand seven hundred and eight satellites that came from earth currently orbiting our planet just in the portion of the sky you can see hundreds of satellites are passing overhead at any given time you often cant see them but theyre theyre making gps work taking images of earth providing communications even spying for governments these satellites are some of the most expensive single objects that can be made if you took a tennis ball sized chunk of the hubble space telescope it would be worth over 1500 modern fullscale commercial grade satellites cost in the hundreds of millions of dollars theyre just incredibly complex objects that require years to construct many of the satellites flying over you right now though started their life here at ssl in palo alto california ssl is a commercial company owned by macs our technology specializing in satellites and spacecraft construction theyve built spacecraft that are currently in orbit for everyone from direct tv to national governments if youve ever watched adelaide tv listen to satellite radio or use satellite internet on a plane theres a decent chance youve directly used one of the satellites they built here in their factory but lets say you want to buy a satellite from ssl what do you do first thing you do is pick up the phone and call us but the next thing you should do is check your bank account to make sure you have enough money to buy a satellite satellites depending on what kind it is and where its going can cost tens of millions of dollars up to several hundred million dollars once a customer makes that first phone call to ssl there will be then an ongoing back and forth between them and the customer essentially the customer will tell ssl what they want their satellite to do an ssl will come back to them with a price eventually if all goes well theyll sign a contract thats exactly what happened a few years ago between ssl and telus at a global satellite company headquartered in canada that owns and operates a fleet of satellites their satellites are used to broadcast signals whether it be tv radio or internet for their customers satellite tv radio and internet providers in this case tell us needed a satellite to provide additional capacity over the busy north atlantic region and so they came and signed a contract with ssl to build their new satellite telstar 19 vantage soon after contracts were signed work began on designing the satellite in that process the designers usually pull designs for some more generic aspects from previous projects and then modify them to suit the particular job the length of that process can vary widely based off how complex the satellite is but throughout that process as soon as theyve locked a design in theyll begin ordering parts ssl builds about half their components themselves and orders the other half from other companies the decision on whether to order or build inhouse usually comes down to performance there are certain components where depending on what the requirements are we build higher performance components than suppliers some of them are suppliers build better components than legion over the years ssl has looked at what its good at and what other suppliers are good at and made the decision on what to order based off that for example one of the components that ssl builds are the antenna reflectors these are what actually direct signals down to earth and each of them is customdesigned for the region that the satellite will cover this is for example for telstra 18 mantich you can see here that these are these reflectors that would be sticking out on the sides and its used for sending signals back to earth and all those little dots you see on there are for photogrammetry so theyre used to make sure that the surface is actually exactly as was designed so we have these cameras that take pictures of these and of all the dots to make sure that it was built according to the design the satellite these antenna reflectors eventually went on telstar 18 vantage the sister satellites of telstar 19 vantage will launch in late august 2018 and soon after will go into service providing data services over asia and oceania the antenna reflector was carefully crafted to provide signal over populated areas and busy flight and maritime corridors while not wasting resources on providing service to areas the company already has coverage for or that would have little demand such as to the south of australia about 9 to 15 months after ordering the majority of the ordered components will start rolling through the door and then the bulk of the assembly process begins this process is too complex to go into detail on but essentially theyll first build the major elements separately one group will assemble the propulsion systems and framework of the satellites while another will assemble the payload with the satellite is actually built to carry whether that be an advanced camera or a communication system well yet another group will assemble the superlight and efficient solar panels that will power the satellite to win in orbit the assembly of the different major components will take a few more months and then theyll start to compile those different major components together over a period of a few more months each component is tested independently before and while being installed on the satellite but once theyre all pieced together there begins an incredibly rigorous phase of testing the satellites as a whole when buying a satellite from a trusted manufacturer like ssl the customer is buying reliability so there can be no compromise on testing they need to be sure that the satellite will actually survive launch and work in space and the best way to do that is to just simulate launch and space there are three major factors that could harm a satellite vibration temperature and sound the vibration comes as a satellite launches in a rocket so they tested their satellites can survive launch when you put one of these satellites on top of a rocket in the payload fairing experience a lot of vibration loads and the xy and z so were able to simulate all of those with this shaker table it has a base plate there and even a shake in this direction this direction or in this direction so it does in all different directions to simulate the environment and make sure that its all operating the subtly on the table in testing here is telstar 19 vantage itself this here is just one of the many tests where they literally just shake the satellites and see how it responds they only last about 60 to 90 seconds each because thats how long the satellite will experience vibration during launch until the rocket reaches the upper atmosphere theyll also be sure that their satellites can survive the vacuum and temperatures of space what you see up there this big blue pumpkin looking thing like cinderellas carriage that one is called our thermal vacuum chamber we like to call it the blue pumpkin and what we use it for is for simulating the thermal vacuum environment of space so well go down to the vacuum level its a space you know 10 to the minus 5 tour and we will turn on the payload and different parts of the satellite to make sure that everything is functioning properly when you put it in space and in addition to that once its under vacuum we have these thermal panels in there to simulate the hot and cold environments or like when youre facing the sun and the satellite gets really hot we make it we bring those temperatures to bear and then we make it really cold when its facing away from earth in the eclipse type of situation and make sure that everything is functioning properly lastly launch is very loud to the point of the acoustic energy could actually damage a satellite so they make sure it doesnt by simulating the launch environment through bombarding the satellites with acoustic energy with speakers there are a myriad of other tests performed before the satellite is given ssl stamp of approval but once its ready the satellite does of course need to get to the launch site the customer decides which launch provider to use whether it be spacex united launch alliance arian space or another so the satellite might only need to go as far as vandenberg air force base a fourhour drive away or as far as baikonur cosmodrome in kazakhstan the launch site is also partially decided based off what sort of orbit this satellite is going into if a satellite is going to orbit in a northsouth direction over the poles they want to launch in that direction so they want to launch from a site with open water to the north or south both for safety and for some rocket designs so stages of rockets can fall into the ocean throughout the launch process spacex for example therefore uses vandenberg air force base in california for their polar orbit launches as it has the pacific ocean directly south for geosynchronous orbits where satellites travel from west to east at the same rate as earth rotates they want to launch in the same direction as the satellites will orbit for that reason they cant launch from vandenberg as it has land to the east so spacex uses the launch pads on cape canaveral florida as they have the atlantic ocean to the east in the case of telstar 19 vantage it was going in geosynchronous orbit in order to stay consistently over its service area so ssl needed to get the satellite all the way across the country to florida no matter where a satellite is going it gets packed up into one of these specialized shipping containers for travel to close launch sites within the us theyll often drive theyll put the container on a truck driven by trusted oversized vehicle drivers have a lead vehicle checking for obstructions a trailing vehicle watching to make sure nothing goes wrong and for longer drives a motor home so drivers can swap out and rest while still moving if the launch site is far such as the ones overseas in french guiana in kazakhstan or even the further ones in the us such as cape canaveral theyll fly the satellite over in an antonov cargo plane satellites arrived to their launch site at least a month before their launch as theres plenty of lastminute preparation to do they have to perform additional testing to make sure nothing was damaged in transport fuel it up and mounted in the rocket once that happens though theres a period where theres really nothing for ssl to do as they go through the process of the countdown there are a number of places where were asked to confirm that were ready for launch and they launch us and at that point we can no longer monitor our satellite until were off the launch vehicle so for about a half hour were hoping that the launch people guys are doing everything okay and they usually are in the case of telstar 19 vantage the customer entrusted spacex with the responsibility of getting their satellite to orbit so on july 22nd 2018 at 150 am a falcon 9 rocket lifted off from cape canaveral carrying ssls latest creation to space the launch of this satellite actually made the record books as it is the heaviest commercial communication satellite to ever be entered into service at fifteen thousand six hundred pounds on that early morning in july the falcon 9 gained altitude as it flew southeast over africa in 32 minutes and 40 seconds after launching 358 miles above mozambique telstar 19 vantage was released from the rocket and gently pushed forward in the first moments of its 15 year long orbit of earth at that point the works not done for ssl though their job is not just to build the satellite but also to enter it into service in space once the satellite is deployed ssl will look for its signal and establish communications and then we start talking to the satellite so we start commanding the satellite we tell the satellite what we wanted to do we start to get the satellite into a safe position after launch golde deploy soil arrays so we can start generating power well start to activate everything on the satellite and then well put the satellite in a safe safe condition so that the crew can get some rest over the next 10 days theres a process of firing the satellites engines to raise it from the altitude of 350 miles where its deployed to 22000 miles where it will stay for its service life theres then another two to four weeks of testing to make sure everythings survived launch and then finally after years of work its time to hand over the satellite to tell us at the customer so they can put it online and start operating it commercially at that point after years of work the satellite can finally itself be put to work one of the aspects of how satellites work that i found most interesting to learn about when i filmed this video was on how orbits work the science of how you can make an object orbit at such a consistent speed that it will stay over one particular area of earth is fascinating

__label__1 ever since manufacturers first discovered the keyword gaming it feels like weve been on a bit of a slippery slope here you see at first gaming was used primarily to describe products endorsed by professional gamers or that had features that were somehow directly related to their gaming utility like headsets with noise cancelling microphones for example but then came gaming power supplys gaming chairs and gaming computer memory none of which perform measurably better than their similarly priced nongaming counterparts so where does this path ultimately lead us to here today in this moment to the epitome of bullsh gaming marketing the gaming microsd card from hyperx lets begin with an entirely on ironic read of the press release the hyperx gaming microsd card is an ideal storage solution for gamers who love downloadable context what are they finding these people and downloadable games but dont want to buy multiple cards or deal with long load times this card features read speeds of 100 megabytes per second and write speeds of 80 megabytes per second and capacities up to 256 gaming bytes so youll get fast access to your games and you can download to your hearts content hyper exes senior manager for console business said that our goal was to bring reliable high capacity and plugandplay storage to mobile gamers and hyperx is excited to make that happen already so as usual theres not a word about exactly what makes these cards gaming and the only performance claims are asterisk as per the tradition so lets start then by exploring just how they came to those numbers we hooked up the 256 gig version to a usb 3 port on our z 370 test bench va kingston card reader and ran crystal disk mark which is what the hyperx rep told us that they used for their performance claims now our results fell well short of the 100 read 80 write claims coming in at 80 87 megs on sequential reads and sixty six point three on writes and then when we sanity check to these results with a sequential file transfer we ended up with very similar results now the disclaimer does say the speed may vary due to host hardware software and usage so digging for the truth we tested the card again in all four major platforms as you can see when paired with an x 299 motherboard we actually came extremely close to the stated claims with x 470 coming in at a close second alright fair enough then hyper x now we move on to our realworld testing mobile game loading time excuse me mobile game loading times starting with android so we used a razor gaming phone and pub g mobile version 08 point oh to determine how long it took from tapping the icon to reaching the login screen and believe it or not the gaming card actually managed to match our onboard storage on the phone which i guess kind of makes sense given that its got the fancy new a1 speed rating which is a newfangled way of saying that itll handle the random io necessary to run apps better than traditional sd cards which are rated only for sequential read and write speeds which i guess brings us perfectly to our next challenger our nongaming highcapacity 512 gig card from integral this puppy is rated at 80 megabytes per second read speeds so not that different but its bad out eh this card is slow morning when we first formatted it and on its first run it got absolutely stomped by hyper xs gaming card gaming sorry so at this point thanks for actually looking pretty darn good for the worlds first gaming micro sd card ah that was until we followed up the test with a couple more rounds of game launches and the issues with our integral card disappeared never to be seen again so after that first launch anomaly our gaming cart is faster but only by about 8 or three seconds to put that in real world terms okay well hyper x is marketing barely even mentions phones anyway so lets move on to our next test device the nintendo switch running the legend of zelda breath of the wild and in a massive surprise to no one just like with our smartphone testing the results came in only marginally different with the switches onboard storage being the fastest no solution achieving a drastic experience altering performance delta over any of the others so um whats left to say then this is a perfectly good micro sd card with a lifetime warranty from a reputable company that will probably still exist in the time that youd actually want any warranty service on this so we are not saying not to buy this were just saying that theres nothing about it that seems to be any more gaming than the socks and sandals that im wearing right now and that the main takeaway today is that regardless of what sd card you choose the experience is unlikely to be dramatically different that is unless youre the kind of person who gets off on sitting next to people with cheaper sd cards on the bus and opening up the same programs as then then gloating about your loading times for three glorious seconds before they are sitting in exactly the same staging area waiting to get on exactly the same parachute bus

__label__1 its a late summers night and you and your friends are out camping by the lake as youre laughing and joking suddenly you hear the snap of a twig coming from just beyond the small circle of dim light your fire creates nervously you laugh it off as a squirrel or other small animal and get back to horsing around when suddenly one of your friends gurgles a dying breath as a machete splits his head open looking up you see a sevenfoot tall figure step out of the darkness and retrieve the machete its him the legends were true welcome to this episode of the infographic show where we pit the average joe against the legendary jason voorhees could you defeat him jason voorhees was born in the small town of crystal lake on june 13th 1946 afflicted with hydrocephalus which created several facial deformities and abnormally large head and mental disabilities jasons mother pamela voorhees kept him away from other kids and took care of him alone at home having no other people in his life jason developed a deep bond with his mother loving and revering her above anything else in the summer of 1957 when jason was 11 years old pamela was unable to get a babysitter for jason and brought him with her to camp crystal lake where she worked as a cook hanging around his mother instead of the other kids he was inevitably ostracized by the other children and eventually bullied for his disabilities one day as he was being bullied jason fled from the kids who chased him to the end of a dock throwing him into the water as a joke the kids watched helplessly as jason began to drown while the camp counselors who were supposed to be supervising the children were having sex in the woods jasons body was never found but the camp was closed as a result opening the next year jasons mother pamela mad with grief murdered the counselors she blamed for jasons drowning unbeknownst to pamela jason had somehow survived his drowning and built a crude shelter for himself where he stayed for years alone jason would ultimately rediscover his mother 20 years later but only moments before she was decapitated by a new camper acting in selfdefense taking his mothers sweater pants severed head and the machete that killed her jason built a shrine to his mother and began his murderous rampage so lets say youre foolish enough to go camping in the area around camp crystal lake what can you expect to go up against well first of all be warned because jason and his mother both blamed his near drowning on teenage promiscuity any drinking or sexual acts are surefire ways to be marked for death by a vengeful jason so keep it in your pants and you might survive but lets say you manage to stumble across jason anyways what should you be prepared for first of all you should be aware of jasons superior strength already a hulking and imposing figure jason stands at nearly seven feet tall and easily weighs over 200 pounds but his strength is far beyond that of a normal human being able to bend even metal pipes jason is also incredibly durable though not impervious to damage he has shown great resiliency even taking a machete to the head and surviving after his accidental resurrection by a lightning bolt though his resilience reached supernatural levels with jason apparently being completely impervious to any fatal damage thats not to say that jason cant be hurt its simply that killing him can be nearly impossible the last thing to be aware of is jasons incredible speed and stealth seemingly able to cover vast distances in surprisingly little time some theorize that jason simply has the ability to teleport to shadowed hidden areas near his prey as when observed physically walking he is typically no faster than the average person and yet routinely surprises and ambushes fleeing prey so how can you survive an encounter with jason the first tip would be to remember that even though he is in fact extremely resilient he is not invulnerable to damage while after his resurrection by a lightning bolt jason seems to be immortal it has been clearly demonstrated that jason can be restrained for years in one location frozen solid or even blown up into small bits your first order of business will be to slow jason down despite his resiliency and slow regenerative powers jason clearly still takes damage with jasons far superior strength a melee weapon such as a club or an axe is completely out of the question youre really just asking for a machete through the skull you need to keep your distance and you need to dish out some serious damage that will slow jason down here is where you want to be thinking much like you would in a zombie survival scenario but forget the headshots which are forkel targets to hit anyways firearms deliver tremendous amounts of kinetic energy at very high speeds and whether youre an undead zombie or an immortal machetewielding mass murder a shattered femur is still impossible to stand up while gut instinct may be to go for a popular shotgun we recommend going instead for something with much more penetrative power your goal after all is to hit structurally vital bones and obliterate them an m4 assault rifle favored battle rifle of the us military can deliver a 556 millimetre round at 2970 feet per second and with a steel penetrating core a few shots to the leg is sure to decimate jasons ability to support his bodyweight on that lip but dont stop there the backbone is extremely important structurally for an upright bipedal animal such as a human helping support the upper body and distribute that weight evenly to the pelvis and thus the legs put a few rounds into jasons backbone and shatter his backbone to watch him crumble over like a sad pancake its important to remember that jason can regenerate though so he wont stay down for long you may be tempted to take this opportunity to run and hide but given jasons ability to seemingly appear from out of nowhere this is probably not a great idea instead keep jason in full view at all times and let him crawl towards you if he regenerates no problem put a few more bone shattering rounds into his vital areas and slow him down again while you cant kill jason it has been shown that you can obliterate his mortal form and force him to return to hell until he reassembles his body so what you want to do is carve jason into pieces but again while staying out of reach of the terrifying machete of its enter the m18 a1 claim or directional antipersonnel mine another favorite toy of the us armed forces unlike a typical mine the claymore is aimed at a target and fired by remotecontrol shooting a pattern of 700 32 millimeter steel balls at a speed of 3995 feet a second a maximum of 250 yards with detonator made out of 25 pounds of c4 the closer you lord jason to your hidden claymore the better and youll have to lure him because another thing jason has shown is that hes not dumb so if your claymore is out in the open forget about it hes not falling for it however if you successfully lure him to within range of your hidden claymore be sure to get him as near as possible while you stay safely out of the firing cone you also want to be somewhat cautious about back blasts although thanks to the ms may chardon effect where a sheet of explosives has its blast directed away from a heavy backing surface such as the claymores rear metal plate you shouldnt be in too much danger yourself aside from possibly shattered eardrums however for jason being on the business end of an exploding claymore is going to ruin his day as 700 steel balls absolutely shred his body jason will come back he always does and to be sure he doesnt regenerate right away we recommend you spend a few hours picking up the meatball sized pieces that are probably all thats left of jasons body and perhaps burning them you can try and appease his spirit by giving his ashes a proper burial near his mothers final resting place at camp crystal lake but in all likelihood its probably just better if you put up a bunch of signs and get stupid teenagers to stop driving to the site of multiple mass murders to make out so how would you

the ceo of reddit explained why he was building a secret house out in the woods where he can stay when the government has collapsed and the city streets are full of chaos there are more of these wealthy survivalists than you might think they even have a facebook page where they share tips on what to do when the end comes and which gasmasks you should buy we want to be ready said one rich venture capitalist when the great earthquake hits california or when civil war tears apart the united states today we are going to take a closer look at such a scenario in this episode of the infographic show could you survive living underground forever  first of all no one really lives underground it doesnt come up at all perhaps the closest thing we have right now is a costa rican man who presently lives in his underground mansion that he calls topple and eeeh hes been called the hobbit and he lives down there with his wife and two kids his 2000 square foot place is between 15 and 63 feet underground has all the mod cons of a normal house including plumbing so thats a start but how long could he stay down there and not come up when experts are asked this question one of the things they come up with before food and water lets say we have enough for a while is what would happen if the sun never touched our skin according to some people the lack of vitamin d that we get from the sun would soon make us pretty depressed and grumpy which might explain the predisposition of people from the united kingdom we would not have much energy either and maybe start to go a little crazy and experience something close to whats called uconn fever so first thing our underground house really should be made with access to sunlight call it a sun room even with a bit of sun scientists say that if we were to spend a long time underground wed end up having much longer sleep cycles we would also require electricity down there which would either mean there are people up above still helping us out or we had an amazing automation system run by advanced robots that we could control from our house in fact automated processes above ground would be pivotal in our survival as farms and factories are presently becoming automated whats to say that in 50 years from now aboveground advanced ai couldnt take care of business and even fix itself when things go wrong but lets say we arent there yet if we are living in a place with almost constant sunshine perhaps we could take our energy from the sun using solar panels we might also take it from the itself something we call geothermal energy in all likelihood if weve had time to prepare for our underground life its probable that we could have electricity for a long time to come wed need access to fresh water the average american consumes 58 gallons of water a year which is about 7200 42 ounces or about two and a half cups a day this doesnt include water that americans consume via soda and other drinks one of the ways we could get fresh water would be to dig until we find a source and it might help if we have brought with us from the top some kind of water purification kit we would also have lots and lots of stored emergency water and we would have a way of collecting rainwater providing of course that above ground is not a toxic hell with all this we should be able to survive wed have to be able to collect the water but also make sure our cave wouldnt flood from water seeping in from above or from another part of our dwelling now we need food we have a huge storage of canned food and other goods that wont perish for a long time but we are pretty much done if we dont have a farm if we have a big enough farm we could even have farm animals down there with us and lets hope allah noahs ark we have two of everything a book that was published this year states that on average we eat about 35 tons or 70000 pounds of food in a lifetime our existence will depend on how we farm underground we grow potatoes and vegetables employing the hydroponic method or the aquaponics method and wed even have a fish farm we will need a plumbing system because if youve watched our show on poo and pee we pretty much fill swimming pools during our lives and no its not a good idea to keep drinking our own pee according to a doctor speaking to slate our urine will become highly concentrated with dangerous waste products and drinking it can cause symptoms similar to those brought on by total kidney failure as for our poo well wed use it to fertilize the soil in which we grow vegetables sanitation would be one of our main concerns because if we get ill that could soon spell the end of days for us our cave could also get smelly so that would mean wed need some kind of ventilation in chiang mai thailand forbes recently reported a highend ultra secure ultra expensive villa project each villa comes with a nuclear shelter underground that is equipped with what is called a hepa air filtration system we are going to have one of those too our main problem would be keeping such a system running while we are underground our plants would also act as air filters the fact is we could no doubt survive for a long long time underground but what most experts talking about the matter say is that psychologically we would suffer it might even start to feel like hell down there a kind of situation not unlike philosopher jeanpaul sartre tears play no exit and thats if you are in a group isolation experts say would also drive us crazy this was a matter of reality for a cult in russia that police discovered in 2012 they lived underground and some of the kids in that cult had never seen the sun a slew of articles follow this amazing story with scientists chiming in on what an underground life might be like a normal lifespan should be possible they said but chronic illness would occur because of the lack of sun and yes wed all be really really moody and depressed according to one story we could make up for our lack of vitamin d by eating lots of eggs of cereal fatty fish cheese and fortified milk we just need to keep producing those things other scientists say we could get rickets diabetes heart disease or suffer from multiple sclerosis or asthma all because our ever giving star is out of our lives in conclusion it all depends how deep down we have to be if very deep perhaps because the atmosphere above is highly toxic we will struggle if we are just hiding from godzilla and can even have a sunroom as we are not far from the surface we will fare better so do you think you are up to

__label__1 so theres this fantastic wikipedia list descriptively titled wikipedia  unusual articles i just remembered as that wikipedia list its a collection of hundreds of articles about unusual unexpected and unbelievable subjects no matter what link you click its bound to be interesting for that reason every week im going to click on a new link and teach you a little bit more about our amazing world which way should the toiletpaper hang over or under its a point of international contention thats been touched on by on the family archie and the simpsons and creates rifts and hundreds of marriages every year to understand the argument lets look at the pros for each orientation well start with over perhaps the greatest objective advantage of this setup is that it reduces the chance that your knuckles will run against the wall this is more than an unpleasant experience it could transfer dangerous germs especially if youre in a public restroom over also makes it easier to grasp the end since the loose end is visually distinguished and further away from the wall hotels cruise ships office buildings and others can also fold the toilet paper to indicate that the room has been cleaned in the over orientation now for the under orientation this way arguably has a tidier appearance since the loose end of toilet paper is more hidden from view it also makes it more difficult for toddlers or pets to unravel the roll if batting at it our v owners also report that a roll hung under is less likely to unravel on its own while driving as a quick side note ill bring you a real letter exchange between a customer and the chairman of southwest airlines herb keller the customer wrote last week in my journey to sfo someone put the toilet paper in wrong any damn fool knows the papers come out the bottom of the roll and not over the top i couldnt figure out how to correct the error herb responded dear jim what the hell were you doing upside down in our laboratory back to the debate in general the public prefers toilet paper hangover most survey is fine between 60 and 70 percent of individuals did they put their toilet paper in the over orientation whats more interesting however is to who prefers which orientation older people tend to have a higher preference to hang their toilet paper over while middleaged people are most likely to hang their tp under whats most interesting is to look at the preferences by socioeconomic class sixty percent of people who are in 50 thousand or more prefer the toilet paper over while seventythree percent of people who were in less than twenty thousand annually prefer the toilet paper under when the researcher barry sin rod was asked what this means he responded i dont know but its sure interesting one other research project concluded that liberals prefer over while conservatives prefer under now lets go a little bit deeper therapist gilda karl theorized that the way someone hangs their toilet paper can tell you something about their personality she says if you roll over you like taking charge crave organization and are likely to overachieve if you roll under your laidback dependable and seek relationships with strong foundations on another note the butler of princess diana paul burrell was asked which method is better and said of course it should be over if it worked down it would unravel all over the floor royals dont have that problem though because they have sheets of tissue which are fanned out into an attractive display and sit in a box so thats one way to solve the issue or we could just look at the patent oh well that settles it it was made to hang over

__label__1 back in march of 2017 algata released the stream deck an utterly unique 15 key keypad with screens on each key designed for livestreaming its caught integration with obs twitch twitter windows algata on products and in august 2017 they added xsplit allowing for us to finally use the stream deck for our weekly podcast the wine show but i rarely stream so why is my twitter feed full of requests to review this thing ill tell you why because they know i dont care what anything was designed to do i care about what it can do and so as the king of macros ill be looking at this product from two angles its intended use and how i use it music tunnel bear makes really simple privacy apps so people can enjoy a more open internet to try tunnel bear free go to tunnel bear comm l tt opening up the stream dex software for the first time youll be greeted by a bunch of actions on the right just drag them onto the buttons on the left try them out in real life and they all pretty much work exactly as you might expect you can control your twitch chat post prewritten messages on twitter change scenes sources and mics in obs and xsplit take screenshots record your screen and even record the last x minutes retroactively lee if you also have an elgato capture card suite and theres a whole lot more but you might be thinking wait teryn cant we already do all that stuff using keyboard shortcuts well no not all of it for one thing keyboard shortcuts arent always easy to remember and depending on your game they can end up conflicting with other commands furthermore because of the magic of api integrations it can even do things like toggling slow mode in twitch chat without you having to manually alt tab to the chat window and position your cursor and then alt tab back to where you were so the stream deck just makes it a lot easier to execute these commands when youre livestreaming a game or whatever else and i was also pretty impressed by the ease of the setup and configuration process but lets go deeper what if 15 actions isnt enough for you fear not you can put actions in folders to fit up to 210 actions onto a single stream deck wait did i say 210 i mean unlimited a recent update allows you to nest folders inside of other folders dog anyway whats the stream deck like to use while streaming not sure what to tell you without sounding repetitive assuming youve set everything up correctly it works exactly as youd expect also the automatic dimming of inactive scenes and sources makes it really easy to tell whats going on just by glancing at the stream deck it just works so for serious streamers the value is pretty clear and thats been thoroughly covered by people who are a lot more into that scene with that said it wouldnt be a terran video without a list of complaints and such questions so here we go the current gui doesnt make it obvious that you can right click here to get more options the webbased image creator is cool but it requires you to save an image onto your computer before you can put it onto the stream deck which adds an extra step the integrated cord is too short the concave key caps can cause reflections making the screens hard to read theres significant parallax on the keys which combined with the stands limited adjustability means that finding a good viewing angle can be quite difficult the stand flops around when you pick it up and it also doesnt really work in portrait mode which is also not supported in the software one of my units suffered from image retention which elgato insists is rare having never been a hardware issue but i still wish there was an automatic sleep mode i wish we had options for font size color and position and simple background colors on the keys i wish i could dynamically change a keys image and function based upon say an ini file somewhere as controlled by a script of my own making i wish that multiple stream decks per computer were supported and i wish that gifts were supported even though it would mostly just be used for fun but despite all this i still really like the stream deck and ive been using it daily at work for several months now but not for twitch streaming i use it for video editing and folder navigation you may have seen my diy 87 macro keyboard video a while ago there have been several developments since then and i have more macro keys on my desk than ever before so the stream deck fits in perfectly its windows integration means that you can assign websites hotkeys and even the direct opening of programs scripts or files an extremely powerful feature in the right hands and these are the right hands wink so after painstakingly restructuring all of my autohotkey scripts to work in such a way that individual functions with parameters could be launched directly from single keys on the stream deck i was able to consolidate my peripherals from this to this and all of the code for that is on my github link below by the way i only did it that way because i literally ran out of key combinations but you can probably just use the key command and have that trigger a script thats a lot more simple now if a hundred and fifty dollars sounds too expensive and you dont think you need all these features you certainly could create a poor mans stream deck by binding some keyboard shortcuts onto a decent numpad like this one and you could use auto hotkey for application directing andor detection you could also add lua macros or interception to make it independent from the normal numpad and then you could print out little images onto envelopes stamps cut them out and paste them onto the keys you would end up with something that looks like this and for only 17 but its a real pain to get all of that working so while it is more expensive i definitely consider the stream deck worthwhile for productivity freaks you guys know who you are and serious streamers alike i still wish it supported gifts though but you know what else doesnt support gifts the masked drop exclusive sennheiser hd 6 xx headphones currently available for only two hundred dollars with free shipping to the usa these are based on the sennheiser hd 650s

__label__1 countries in the world come in all different shapes and sizes some are huge while others are tiny and then some have very clearly defined shapes like these and others well not so much borders are a funny thing and dont often make sense without some historical or geographical context sometimes borders take on an exceptionally bizarre look extending away from the home country like a tentacle or an extra limb this is called a panhandle or a salient and we are going to look at five of the strangest examples of these from around the world to begin with were going to italy to look at this example the province of trieste this province extends 48 kilometers or 30 miles down the coast away from italy and into slovenia history is the reason why this situation exists today basically this entire territory used to be a part of the austrohungarian empire and outside of battlefield one nobody has ever heard that name in a very long time because world war one happened and italy took over a bunch of their land after winning but then mussolini happened in italy lost world war two and therefore lost pretty much all of that territory that they had won in the first war trieste became an independent citystate under un protection in 1947 but that only lasted until 1954 when the tiny countrys territory was divided between italy and yugoslavia the part that italy occupied in 1954 remains the border of today and that is why the border here looks so on next up at number four we are going pretty far away to india which looks mostly normal except for this mess over here in the east zooming in a little closer we can see that this side of india and this side of india is connected by only a very tiny sliver of land known as the siliguri corridor this awkward situation like every other entry on this list from here on out came about as a result from colonialism when india gained independence from the united kingdom in 1947 the british decided to partition india between a hindu part in a muslim part pakistan became the muslim part and at the time consisted of west pakistan here and east pakistan here pakistan was separated by all of india from her two halves and the northeast of india was only connected by the siliguri corridor at one point the corridor is not even 27 kilometers or 17 miles wide the indian state of sikkim extends north of the corridor and separates nepal from bhutan and they connect to the seven other indian states in the east with a population of almost 45 million people between them so 45 million indians are connected to the rest of their country by a corridor that at one point is only 27 kilometers long were going to move slightly up north to afghanistan for our next example much like how an appendix serves no clear purpose to humans any longer the wacken corridor in afghanistan seems like it makes no sense it is a part of afghanistan that stretches out for a very long 350 kilometers or 220 miles away from the rest of the country and with the corridor varies from between just 13 kilometers to 65 kilometers or 8 to 40 miles the corridor means that afghanistan shares a tiny land border with china and completely separates tajikistan from pakistan it doesnt make much sense now but pushing the clock back over a century explains why it exists today in the 19th century the russian and british empires were both competing for territory here russia ruled central asia and britain ruled india to settle a dispute between either empire gaining more land and influence in the region both agreed to respect afghanistan as an independent country that would serve as a buffer region between them but the borders of afghanistan at the time didnt exactly match up between the russian and the british borders so they decided to expand afghanistan 350 kilometers east to fit between the rest of the space over a century later the corridor remains but as a border between tajikistan and pakistan our next two entries are both located in africa whose colonial past is obvious when you look at the continents borders were going to start with the democratic republic of the congo which is not one but two panhandles the congo used to be a colony of belgium and the belgians created this one on the left called congo central so that they could access their enormous colony from the ocean the second down here is called the congo pedicle it cuts between 200 kilometers into zambia and varies between 70 to 100 kilometers wide the pedicle is even more awkward than it looks basically back when the congo was a belgian colony and zambia was a british colony the two sides could not agree on the colonial borders the belgians wanted access to the rich swamp lands here that had a lot of wildlife they could hunt for their precious trophies so the two sides got the king of italy to intervene and draw the border for them knowing about as much about africa as you would expect of a man in the 19th century before the internet the king just drew a line on a map front of him and decided that it looked good and the two other sides thought that it looked good enough in boom there was the border and its still there today finally and perhaps most bizarrely we have the case of namibia which has this absurd protrusion in the northeast of the country this extension is called the caprivi strip and it goes for 450 kilometers or 280 miles away from the rest of namibia this bizarre border exists because between 1884 and 1915 namibia was a colony of germany in 1890 the chancellor of germany named leo von caprivi for whom the strip is named after wanted the colonies ordered to extend to the zambezi river here so the germany could navigate the river to the african east coast in a treaty with britain germany gave up all colonial claims to the territory of zanzibar and in exchange was granted the strip stretching hundreds of kilometers across the continent it makes less sense when you look at an actual ethnic map of africa which roughly looks like this as you can see the strip covers numerous ethnic and linguistic groups that were not taken into any consideration prior to the decision today the existence of the strip means that botswana is almost entirely blocked off from bordering zambia other than a very tiny opening on the zambezi river here and anna mae bia almost border zimbabwe just 200 meters down the same river there are a lot of other strange borders in the world to be covered

__label__1 even after wearing it for two weeks half the time i forget the fitbit versa is on my wrist its the lightest least obtrusive fitness tracker ive ever worn yes its got a duller design than last years fitbit ionic but its also a much better smartwatch than that one wasnt release at a much lower price  im mr mobile and this is the fitbit versa review music the versa is one of those products you really need to use to understand seeing it on the screen its natural to draw comparisons to the apple watch or maybe to the old pebble time put out by the company fitbit acquired in 2016 not being a fan of square watches or big bezels i didnt find a lot to like in the versa when i saw the announcement but when i slapped it on the featherweight build made me forget all about the casing design and the mostly black interface distracted me from the big picture frame here the display is small but its great its vibrant and plenty bright for outdoor use and while it is a touchscreen you also have the option of using the side keys to control some of the ui you can also assign long press shortcuts to some functions which is very handy if you used to watch this from apple or google the feature youll probably most appreciate is the endurance instead of charging every night i was able to get through a solid four days wearing the versa and once up to six days when i turned off notifications and just use it as a fitness tracker that means you can keep it on your wrist most nights and the versa will track your sleep quality using an alwayson pulse monitor and accelerometer i like learning about my sleep patterns with this feature its easy to forget that health isnt just a step count oh in the same vein this spring both the versa and ionic will get updated with female health tracking features when you do need to charge it the cradle is a little bulky but at least its straightforward squeeze to charge squeeze to stop charging despite the broader take on health that devices like this are encouraging most folks still think of exercise when they see a fitbit to test out those features i went to my least favorite place on the whole planet the gym fire up a o l instant messenger i mean the exercise hub and youll get customized tracking for things like running on treadmills or ellipticals or my favorite weightlifting to see more of michael fishoutofwater please subscribe to the mr mobile on youtube okay in all seriousness the exercise modes work pretty well for tallying things like calorie burn so on and there are twenty custom workout profiles in the app if youre less of a runner and more of a spinner or martial artist i was dismayed not to see kayaking them when youre not in the gym you can get a quick snapshot of your current activity level by swiping up from the bottom of the screen or you can swipe down from the top to see the most recent notifications passed on from your phone step counts over my two weeks with the versa have agreed with other devices on my person though the verse it does like to give you a lot of bonus steps that you havent really earned i get constant pats on the back for sitting at my desk typing which i dont think is intended for folks who need a different type of motivation fitbit labs has some experimental apps like treasure trek which turns walking into a pirate style treasure hunt fitbit says apps like this get some users to log about 50 more steps per day get further from fitness and the versa stumbles a bit as a smartwatch the software is still fairly bland in design and more sluggish than pretty much all of the competition theres also this annoying bug where youll get multiple vibrations for the same alert if you havent checked old notifications when a new one comes in tough to describe but basically it just means your wrist is buzzing a lot more often than it should be and while there are plenty of watch faces available there are very few thirdparty apps those things come with time though after years of designing devices with a pure exercise focus the versa is only fitbits second real stab at a smartwatch and the pace of improvement from the ionic release less than a year ago has been impressive the android quick reply feature is coming soon so youll be able to respond to messages from your wrist this and many of the verse has features will be back ported to the ionic given that fact and the ionics other advantages for fitness tracking like standalone gps you shouldnt feel the need to buy the versa if you already own the earlier device but if youre looking for your first wearable and you want something that splits the difference between fitness tracker and smartwatch yeah the versa is a very good option thats especially true if your daily driver is an iphone as an alternative to the apple watch the fitbit is less expensive and a bit less complex with substantially better battery life over on the android side the question is a tougher one officially fitbit only supports a handful of devices most of them laughably old its broadest compatibility is with samsung phones which is weird because samsung already sells a compelling suite of fitness wearables in its gear line so yeah lots of room for improvement on the android side of things the fitbit versa goes on sale april 16 comes in three colors for 199 thats for the version i reviewed toss in an extra 30 bones and you can pick up the special edition graphite or rose gold editions with custom watchbands like my leather and metal ones running you 50 bucks a piece and be prepared for some frustration when dealing with those fiddly release switches i think those prices are fair despite its rough patches the versa is a much stronger product than i might have expected as a sophomore effort and its my new goto recommendation for those in search of an apple watch alternative

__label__1 serial killers while being some of the worst humans in existence never failed to intrigued and fascinated these include ted bundy the educated maniac who murdered scores of young women in the 1970s jeffrey dahmer aka the milwaukee cannibal and john wayne gacy without a doubt the scariest clown in human history over the pond in the uk they had dr death harold shipman who could be said to be the most prolific serial killer in modern times with a body count of around 250 people psycho edie gained didnt kill many folks yet his hobby of making clothes and ornaments out of body parts inspired a lot of gruesome horror movies but today were going to focus on one of the most intriguing serial killers of all time in this episode of the infographic show why was jack the ripper never found we cant start this show with an introduction of who jack the ripper was because no one knows along with the zodiac killer mr ripper has become one of the biggest mysteries in the bloody world of serial homicides but lets have a look at what he did his handiwork which included killing and eviscerating women on the streets of london scared the brits witless in the late 19th century he did most of his work in the slums of east london in a district of whitechapel which is why he was also called the whitechapel murderer another name he was given was the leather apron he got the name of jack the ripper from a letter he ostensibly wrote to police known as the dear boss letter so what did jack do well the story goes that in the 1880s east london was a place of absolute squalor immigrants from all over the world flooded there for work but that didnt always work out for them crowded streets were festooned with what the english might call habitual boozers and women of ill repute could be seen lingering on many a street corner people blame the immigrants for high spikes in crime and overcrowded streets racism was pervasive as were fights and robberies the police had their hands full as london was on the brink of social unrest and rioting but the police in 1888 got the shock of their lives when a murderer came to life and he wasnt like any killer theyve ever seen its thought that he could have killed 11 people but police report that they can only say he definitely killed 5 people these are known as the canonical 5 meaning they were part of his killer canon now 11 bodies isnt such a big deal when you consider the ted bundys of the world while bundy was a necrophile the ripper had arguably even stranger proclivities he used the knife as you might guess from his name slashing throats and bodies sometimes to ribbons but he also mutilated womens genitals made all kinds of incisions on their bodies and skillfully removed their internal organs this surgery might include removing the kidneys uterus or generally any parts of the abdomen area sometimes hed just hack away at the womens faces so they were unrecognizable now because east london was such a crap hole in those days police cant be sure if lots of other murders at the time were his doing or people were just copying him jack the ripper was huge in the media and the frenzied mostly workingclass public ate up this wicked story with as much enthusiasm as us modern folks might lap up horror stories and the dubious tabloid the daily mail police worked hard trying to find out who was responsible for the heinous crimes interviewing thousands of people and detaining over 80 of them rewards would be given for any advice on this ripper and so even regular people were out investigating this crime east london was patrolled by cops 247 and amateur sleuths were not far behind them police were focused on people with certain occupations given that removing a uterus is not something most people can do it said jack was an expert with his blade and so cops looked at butchers surgeons doctors physicians and generally anyone who might cut up bodies for a living as for the letters to police quite a few of them claimed to be written by the ripper but the most famous of those was the from hell letter police believed this letter was the only one that was genuine postmarked 15th of october 1888 it went like this mr luss im sending you half the kidney i took from one woman i preserved a piece of it for you the other piece i fried and ate it was very nice i may send you the bloody knife that took it out if only wait a while longer signed catch me when you can mr luff see the writer appears to be barely literate so did this count out surgeons and doctors doing the killing or was a welleducated geezer just being rather cheeky in his writing style over time many suspects have been put forward as to the rippers identity well give you a rundown on the main ones the principal suspect was a verified sexually insane doctor called montague john pruitt he was found dead in the river tames and guess what that was about a month after the last ripper murder the there was no doubt welleducated being rather posh but was also of what then was called unsound mind another suspect was a polish immigrant called sura in class house key this wicked geezer poisoned and killed three of his wives he was then hanged or was it the wealthy trader called james maybrick may bricks diary was apparently found in liverpool in 1992 in the diary this man talks about going on a murder spree killing only women because his wife had been unfaithful to him you are thinking that could have been any old murder spree but this was also in the diary i give my name that all know of me so history do tell what love can do to a gentle man born yours truly jack the ripper police also thought a man they called a mad russian could have been involved his name was michael awestruck but everyones favorite conspiracy theory is that of prince albert victor christian edward the duke of clarence this aristocrat grandson of queen victoria died in an asylum after syphilis had destroyed his mind its also said he couldnt have done the wicked deeds as he wasnt in london at the time but a lot of investigators believed it was aaron kosminski as his mitochondrial dna was found on one of the victims shawls his occupation barber now who wouldnt want to have a close shave from him german merchant sailor karl feigenbaum even admitted to mutilating women and his lawyer said he was the ripper for sure he emigrated to america and guess what happened there he murdered a woman was caught and was subsequently fried in the usas infamous electric chair in the 20th century two more names were put forward with some ripper ologists yes thats a word confident that they got their man one was artist walter richard sickert whose dna was linked to the murders the impotent artist chose mostly to paint you guessed it prostitutes last on the list is frances craig a reporter that actually covered the murders oh one special suspect we should mention was alice in wonderland author lewis carroll real name charles lutwidge dodgson a great writer but also a man suspected of being a pedophile apparently his friend said he had seen diary entries in carrolls diaries connecting him to the murders so why did the police never get him there are a lot of folks out there that believe it was the mad prince if it was him police could never have made an arrest not only because they wouldnt have the power to take down a royal but because britain was very much in those days under the spell of monarchical myth and power a murderous prince with a penchant for pulling out womens kidneys would have been a devastating threat to national security and a huge blemish on englands ruling classes if the socalled commoners were already fighting in the streets a ripper prince may have caused widespread havoc but we might also remember that the ripper was a very careful murderer one reason why many people put forward names of educated people as suspects he left hardly any clues in a time when police often relied on nothing more than catching criminals in the act or having bullet proof witness testimonies there was no dna testing no such thing as fingerprints no psychological profiling no closedcircuit tv and to top it all off much of the public at that time hated the cops and were really unhelpful he also killed poor people and prostitutes and one could say these people in those days werent considered very important some ripper ologists also believed there could have been two killers as two murders sharing ripper trademarks once occurred at the same time we should take into account that london was jampacked in those days with four million people living in those sometimes dingy unlit areas of squalor its a fact that in those dark satanic london streets of the past many murders went unsolved cops just werent that skilled and were without modern technology they were so desperate they even dressed up as women and hung about in the east end hoping the killer might strike them so who do you think jack the refer was

__label__1 popular youtuber says apple wont fix his eye mac pro damaged while disassembled illinformed youtuber bemoans apple repair policies after breaking imac pro youtube channel claims apple is refusing to fix its broken imac pro how is it even possible that so many people dont check this at all and the worst part is that this is far from over thankfully ive got i fix it music so first off i really want to give a huge thank you to everyone out there who contributed advice suggestions or even offered to come and help us out directly without you guys this update video would not have been possible and even worse than that i dont think wed be seeing all the discussion that we have about our circumstances and what they mean for right to repair fair repair would open a whole market of reuse for customers and their electronics the pressures frustrations and limited access of standing on a line to speak to someone at the genius bar or they dont even serve appletinis will be lifted from consumers okay so a refresher then for those of you who missed it or forgot we knew that we werent going to get warranty service on our imac pro and were not even talking warranty service we understood we would have to pay we wanted to pay but we did at least expect apple to be able to offer us a reasonable repair solution and thats how the go expectation im not talking like you know when angry do you guys even know who i am im lennis texted like im not talking about that kind of thing apple actually averted a similar pr crisis with quinn nelson over at snazzy labs by just eating the cost of an imac pro and sending him a new one but as he pointed out so i did walk out of the store with a brand new imac but i asked myself the question what they have done this for anyone and our goal here was to have the normal customer experience so there have been some arguments in favor of apples position here not repairing this and lets address the main ones before we go any further starting with apple is refusing to quote you a repair cost because it will be higher than the cost of a brand new machine you idiot and my response to that is pretty simple a mac is not special its not magic its just a computer so a broken screen maybe a fried motherboard and also maybe a bad power supply does not turn a 5000 workstation into scrap metal we know from our price breakdown of the imac pro that apple charges about market rates actually for their parts when you buy them integrated in a complete system so even if i picked topoftheline components the worst case scenario parts cost should be about 2100 us dollars and if they were willing to provide those parts wed expect to pay a couple hours of labor for another few hundred dollars or so definitely not enough to cancel out the value of the cpu ram ssd chassis and cooler that are probably all still working theyre not that difficult to repair the reality of it is we just slipped these things do happen next up is the liability argument what about apples liability for the long term functionality of that machine well what about it i mean if you take your computer said i dont know lets say geek squad for repairs theyll do the work complete a wider check of the machine to see if theres anything else wrong with it and then even then warranty their repairs in case they miss something i mean is the argument really that apple of all people cant do a comprehensive check of its own hardware and has so little faith in the training of its technicians that they cant guarantee your repair if that were true i dont think we should buy computers from them at all this kind of stuff industry standard stuff back to the training bit though that one was a tough nut to crack so we were actually accused of making false claims about the availability of apples repair certification for the imac pro with other publications going as far as to contact apple authorized service providers in the states who confirmed that they already had it so heres what actually happened it was available to at least some a peas at the time we did our video however it wasnt available to our local aaas p so that got me thinking well theres my chair maybe this is like a canadaus thing but then i spoke personally to an american asp technician who said and this is after our local shop got certified mind you that he wasnt going to be able to get it for a couple more months so something about the way that apples rolling these programs out to their aas peas isnt quite right here but for now though we need to get back to addressing the problems that we identified in our first video and fixing this stupid professional workstation that has been out of commission for months now is well thats thats pretty much the problem so coming back to certifications the training and parts availability has actually improved dramatically since our first video and we were finally able to take our imac to an asp who assured us that they could get the job done at the end so thanks for watching guys if this video sucked you know what  hahaha no im just kidding nothing is ever that easy you see while we managed to get our display replaced for a reasonable price thanks to qualifying for what they call return pricing where you send the original part back to apple for disposal we actually broke the warranty void if removed stickers around our cpu socket this one right here so what that means is that because of that sticker we didnt qualify for return pricing on our logic board which it turns out is a really bad thing because apple wants five thousand five hundred canadian rupees plus tax for a new logic board which for some reason includes both the cpu and the ram even though contrary to what a lot of our detractors thought they are socketed and not soldered on this particular system so that is about double of apples old price for this hardware when they sell you the system originally and that is how much they charge the aas peas so if an authorized service provider fails to return a defective part during the exchange for any reason they get dinged for the price of the replacement part in what is a clear effort to prevent any spare parts from making their way out into the wild which makes it pretty hard to get your hands on this stuff and interestingly this is far from the only punitive measure that apple appears to be willing to inflict upon its partners from talking to them we were struck by the culture of fear that apple cultivates among its authorized service providers they explicitly prevent them from ordering replacement parts for the sake of having them on hand so what that means is that they require a work order to be placed before the part will even be shipped which creates massive delays of potentially weeks for something as simple as a ram swap which makes the asp look bad in comparison to apples own service centers but thats apples policy to make matters worse if an asp attempts to order a part that they dont yet have the certification for apple will send them a fine instead of the parts they ordered and this is all for the privilege of having access to apples supply chain oh and the best part is anyone caught talking about any of this to anybody outside of apple for them this is grounds for severe retaliation revocation of asp status or certifications fines or even potential legal action only a handful of brave souls were willing to tell us their names or the names of the shops they ran or worked for and of course we are going to be keeping all of that info in private in order to protect them by comparison samsung has a web portal that you can log into and order any replacement phone parts that you could want so at that kind of markup over a sticker the a asp option was obviously out we really would have been better off ordering a brandnew imac pro but another one of you guardian angels out there who also shall not be named for legal reasons stepped up to the plate now were getting to the point where the solutions that were working on wouldnt be available to joe average but even though it was a lot of work we really wanted to know how deep this rabbit hole goes so it ended up being a case of i know a guy who knows a guy who knows a guy so given how much money was being exchanged i was sketched out to the max but after a series of backalley deals like almost literally backalley deals our contact managed to get us this a brandnew imac pro logic board complete with cpu and ram for two thousand us dollars and heres the kicker if our contact d ghostified because right now hes sort of gone dark if our contract shows back up again and can get us exchanged pricing that could actually become as low as zero dollars so uhoh excellent ive got a calculator so lets lets do some quick math for you guys our screen and power supply replacement at the asp cost was roughly fourteen hundred us dollars including labor and shipping thanks to return pricing at worst we can add another two thousand dollars on top of that so logic board and thirty four hundred us dollars how much does an imac pro cost again so sorry haters it looks like youre wrong i guess if it wasnt for apples anticonsumer anteye partner and possibly looking at whats going on with wright to repair in the states right now illegal policies it would be possible to get the replacement parts for less than the retail price of a new unit only one thing remains now then we still dont actually know if our frankenstein machine works or not and i could get anthony to test it but i think we all know what happened last time i cant believe that some people thought that this was intended to deceive the audience by the way it was clearly a csi style dramatic reenactment look at the sparks were not even good at special effects anyway this video is long enough already and i think ive got a better idea and some of you will probably already know where im going with this hey louis i think ive got a fun little project for us have you ever worked on an imac pro before we dont stop watching yet i have a teaser and an offer for you the teaser is we have a video up coming with wendell from level one time gaming on linux its better than you think unless you think its perfect in which case its not better than you think but dont worry about that also p ia

and when was the last piece of land on earth that was discovered by humans to start literally at the beginning of humanity we go back to ethiopia in 195 thousand bc we dont really know exactly when humanity discovered certain parts of the world this long ago but we do have our best guesses that we can make based off a fossil evidence that has been discovered so lets go with our best guesses for now the oldest homo sapiens fossils to date were found in ethiopia so human exploration likely started from here with an entire world to explore it took until 140000  160000 years ago for humans to discover modernday sudan but by 125000 years ago humans had reached the southern point of the african continent and at the same time had also crossed the sea into arabia or modernday yemen this new group of arabian based humans had reached israel by 100 thousand years ago and oman by 75000 to 125000 years ago back in africa 90 thousand years ago humanity had reached the democratic republic of the congo back over again in asia 70000 years ago humans first arrived in india and 67 thousand years ago had reached the philippines marking the first time that humans arrived in oceania fifty thousand years ago humans first arrived in taiwan and 50000 to 80000 years ago humans also arrived in egypt for the first time humans arrived in australia fortyeight thousand years ago those early settlers to australia and their descendants would remain almost completely undisturbed by the rest of the human population until 1770 with the arrival of captain james cook a guy who liked doing that a lot well get back to him later so about 47000 years ago humans arrived in japan and 1000 years later arrived in laos and indonesia finally 45000 years ago humans arrived in greece which was the first place and first time that humans arrived in europe usually when humans arrived somewhere for the fur time things die so naturally the neanderthals of europe would mysteriously vanish 5000 years later humans settled italy 43000 years ago and based on our knowledge of fossils somehow skipped france and arrived in the uk around 43 thousand years ago and germany 42 thousand years ago on the other side of the world humans had discovered china 39000 to 42000 years ago tasmania fortyone thousand years ago and new guinea forty thousand years ago sometime later thirty four thousand years ago humans got around to discovering sri lanka and then we discovered another new continent north america was settled 25 thousand to forty thousand years ago from across that land bridge that used to exist because walking somewhere is somewhat easier than inventing boats to sail there and thats why there were millions of people already here when columbus arrived but anyway by twenty eight thousand years ago a good chunk of europe had been explored including france the czech republic romania poland and russia portugal was finally reached twenty four thousand five hundred years ago and sicily twenty thousand years ago so strangely this means that humans had reached to north america before humans reached portugal but anyway the mainland united states was first reached sixteen thousand years ago and humans first arrived in south america fourteen thousand eight hundred years ago where the oldest remains have been found in chile back across the ocean in europe scandinavia was first settled by humans in around nine thousand two hundred bc and ireland in 7700 bc the baltic states were first settled around then in 7600 bc over in asia cambodia was reached in seven thousand bc and this super remote island above siberia called yaakov island was somehow discovered back in 6300 bc which is weird because theres still a lot left undiscovered jumping back a continent malta was discovered at 5200 bc and across another ocean puerto rico was eventually discovered at 4000 bc which coincidentally is when the sid meiers civilization games all began this is presumably when people started sending out their settlers for the first time greenland was reached in 2000 bc fiji vanuatu and samoa were all reached around 1000 bc by the polynesians a while went by with no new discoveries until 209 ad when hawaii was also finally discovered by the polynesians they remained there undisturbed by the rest of humanity until 1778 when that same guy named james cook had to land on their islands as well anyway the next big discovery was madagascar which despite being enormous and right next to africa remained undiscovered by humans until 500 ad the roman empire rose and fell and in that entire time there were no humans on madagascar what else is weird is that the first settlers here didnt come from africa like you would think but came on canoes all the way from borneo across the entire indian ocean so moving on the faroe islands above scotland were discovered in 600 ad the bahamas at 850 ad and iceland remained untouched by humanity until the vikings founded in 874 a be the final significantly large and habitable place to be discovered by humans was new zealand which saw no humans until the arrival of the maori polynesians sometime between 1250 and 1300 next we enter the great age of european exploration in which were about to find out  only resulted in the real human discoveries of a few scattered islands the portuguese are the first humans to land on six of these islands in a row madeira in 1420 the azores in 1439 cape verde in 1462 annobn in 1474 south tomei and prncipe in 1485 and one poor exiled portuguese soldier landed on st helena in 1516 the only place the spanish were the first to arrive at where the bonin islands south of japan in 1543 and the polynesians landed on the chatham islands in 1550 the last such polynesian discovery back over in europe this frozen hell hole called svalbard were made untouched by humans until an english whaler landed here in 1604 bermuda was landed on by a group of shipwreck englishmen at 1609 and yan mayon was also first landed on by a whaler in 1615 mauritius was landed on by the dutch in 1638 and the dodo quickly vanished from the island afterwards reunion island was reached in 1642 by the french tristan da cunha by the dutch in 1643 the falkland islands by the english in 1690 which would remain almost totally irrelevant until margaret thatcher rodriguez island in 1691 by the french ill st paul and ile amsterdam both by the dutch in 1696 ascension island was first landed on in 1701 by 60 shipwrecked englishmen who were stranded there for two months the seychelles in 1770 by the french the kerguelen islands in 1772 also by the french south georgia in 1775 by that overachiever james cook once again lord howe island in 1788 by the british and prince edwards island in 1799 by the french by 1800 there really wasnt a whole lot left to discover but that didnt stop people from trying and succeeding the south shetland islands were landed on in 1819 by the british matt curry island in 1820 by the russians the south orkney islands in 1821 by the british and the carosi islands also in 1821 by some british sealers that got shipwrecked and stranded there for over two years well thats about it ah right except for the seventh continent thats bigger than australia at the bottom of the globe antarctica was never even seen with human eyes until 1820 when this russian explorer discovered it but failed to actually land on it that means that humans had seen the planet uranus before anybody had ever seen antarctica so after seeing it in 1820 it took a while to actually land on the continent it wasnt until 1895 that the first confirmed landing happened by a team of norwegians and with that moment every piece of land on planet earth from 195 thousand bc all the way until 1895 had been finally landed on by the human species

__label__1 there are millions of lakes in the world and canada is home to over 60 of them fortunately for canadians though none of these lakes are anywhere near as bad as the most dangerous one in the world which is actually located here in africa between the democratic republic of the congo and rwanda this is lake ki vu and if you look at pictures of it on google it doesnt really look all that dangerous so what gives its kind of a big lake i guess its the ninth deepest lake in the world  but that means that there is 8 more that are even deeper theres other lakes like this one thats literally called boiling lake because the temperature can get up to 92 degrees celsius so what makes the innocentlooking lake evoo so dangerous it probably has something to do with the fact that the lake seems to occasionally explode and kill everything around it but how does that happen a lake exploding sounds pretty weird but its because it doesnt happen very often the first time in recorded history that we observed something like this was just back in 1984 at another african lake here lake malloon on august 15th of that year local people reported hearing a loud noise and seeing a gas cloud emanating from the lake 37 people ended up dying with reports of skin discoloration which led investigators to initially believe that the incident was a terrorist attack but two years later the nearby lake nyos experienced a very similar but even more catastrophic event heres what really happened in both cases the lakes were completely saturated with gases like co2 this co2 may have come from volcanic gas below the lakes or from the decomposition of organic materials but the end result of a high concentration of the gas in the water is the same before the lake becomes saturated though it behaves much like an unopened soft drink meaning that the co2 is dissolved in the water in both the lake and the soft drink co2 dissolves much more readily at higher pressure this is why bubbles in a can of soda form only after the can is opened the pressure is released and so the co2 comes out of solution in the case of lakes the bottom experiences way higher pressure than the surface the deeper it is the higher the pressure at the bottom is this means that huge amounts of co2 can be dissolved in large deep lakes like both of these were co2 also dissolves more readily in cooler water like at the bottom of a lake so once a lake is saturated with co2 like this it becomes extremely unstable all it takes is a trigger event like a volcano earthquake or explosion to set the whole thing off whatever the cause the trigger event pushes the saturated water higher into the lake where the lowpressure cant keep the co2 contained any more bubbles start forming at the surface a column of gas erupts on top the water at the bottom is pulled up by suction which causes a runaway loss of co2 and an eventual explosion imagine shaking a can of soda and opening it but on an epically bigger scale at lake nyos this event happened in the middle of the night and sent a 25 meter high tsunami surging into the other side of the beach the lake turned a deep red and a 12 cubic kilometer toxic gas cloud of co2 started migrating off the water and into the nearby villages because co2 is denser than air it has a bad tendency to stick to the ground while pushing breathable air up as a result when the cloud entered the surrounding villages people couldnt breathe and experienced severe co2 poisoning nearly everyone around the lake that night died and people as far away as 25 kilometers even suffered from it in all over 1700 people lost their lives in the catastrophe as well as thousands of cattle and wild animals but as bad as all of that was the potential for the same thing happening at lake evoo would be a lot worse these leg explosions are called limnic eruptions and lake key vu has the exact same symptoms that the previous two lakes had the only differences are that lake kevo is a lot bigger and has a lot more gas built up inside of it 65 cubic kilometers of methane and a 256 cubic kilometers of co2 2 million people live around the shores of the lake and if an eruption were to happen here all of their lives would be in jeopardy even creepier though geologists operating around the lake discovered evidence that suggested a local extinction event happens about once every 1000 years that wipes out a large part of the local wildlife if its the lake exploding once every thousand years like it seems well thats pretty bad news so what are we doing to fix this problem not really anything at all right now the rwandan government extracts a lot of methane from it for purposes but its probably not enough to guarantee that the disaster wont ever happen at the first two lakes i talked about theyve installed a series of pipes to release the gas above the surface but since lake kivu is so much bigger that may not be as practical releasing that much gas would be 2 of the annual amount humanity releases from burning fossil fuels and it would cost millions of dollars to do which the neighboring countries may not be so willing to spend the solution to the most dangerous lake in the world remains elusive and with no clear answer in sight it may only be a matter of time until another disaster happens if you want to be the one to come up with the answer you can

__label__1 all right welcome to scrapyard wars where luke and i try to build the best computers we can with a set of guidelines and a fixed budget so this is our first episode where im looking for a lot of feedback from you guys about what we can do to make these fun and interesting in the future but for todays challenge we are keeping it very simple 300 cash the very best gaming rig that we can build with a few rules so number one is no monitor or other peripherals required we only have to build the tower no worker research can be pre done so you cant like go on websites or craigslist and try to find things before or inbetween each participant gets a total of eight hours to actually find everything and then four hours to build it tune it and benchmark it cuz im not paying any overtown on this so we are staying inside those guidelines no leveraging friends social media contacts coworkers or anything of that sort overclocking is allowed well be measuring performance of the machines using 3d mark firestrike tomb raider 2013 and dirt three and along with the new peripherals thing its just a tower that you need no operating system or anything like that so lets get to it shall we retro floors music yeah yeah we know you have exceeded your daily transaction limit please take your receipt i see declined okay then ima go inside i have the cashola alright lets go shall we good luck i should have known hed never fall for that im fairly sure hes going to waste time going back to the office i brought a laptop with me so i will begin immediately i really hope its charged theres a store somewhere in vancouver i think its called reboot its a nonforprofit little store thing that kind of refurbishes computers and sells computers and does kind of cheap repairs and stuff for people that need it and i think if i can participate in this contest and support a company that tries to like they do really cheap computer repairs and i know they try to like i think they do some charity giving computers to people and stuff if i can help them out get a cheap computer from them and participate in the contest then thats doing many things well at once so im gonna try and see if i can do that im going to contact them figure what their hours are and go from there now were rockin yeah jesus laughter all right so should we started on red flag deals used to be used to be a haunt for me i used to find a lot of good stuff there the linus tech tips buy sell trade that craigslist you want me to call anthony ah oh oh that no were not allowed to leverage friends and this is where the like montage music has to come in dont dont buy a laptop that might be the best we can do and then this guy also had a hard drive for 20 bucks oh he likes it does he okay good excellent that means literally nothing so an intel core2duo with 80 gigabyte hard drive oh god and two gigabytes of ram for 50 bucks though so it leaves me 250 to get a guy off his card let me give them a call music this is why we dont make tv shows there seems to be a pretty significant drop in price once you get to court you do arrange so im looking for that because i think thatll be fine for most of the games itll fall behind a bit for sure on tomb raider are they gonna come to concede defeat are they going theyre not allowed to take out more money oh theyre trying to film things better than just pointing the camera at me in the car cutsies whoa this could be oh is this that same freakin guy well he has a case he has a cx 500 power supply  if i hear back from this guy i dont think lukes gonna think to check kijiji okay 45 and then this is a combo and then this is a combo whoo computer cases with power supplies and other hardware phone calls only please all right here we go hi hi you have a craigslist listing for computer cases with power supplies and 10 or something so do you have anything reasonably new with a 24pin power supply and compatibility for a micro atx board like some kind of standard board or is it all gonna be nonstandard like dell hp stuff thats an athlon oh okay thats a little older than i need im looking for an entry level gaming pc if you can just tell me what cpus the systems that you have im very familiar with the ha im very familiar with the hardware i know what im looking for i just need to know what you have oh okay that that might actually be very helpful my name is linus what im trying to accomplish is today i want to find my platform so everything ill need and then tomorrow essentially i want to spend the entire time finding the best possible price that i can on a gpu its like my whole plan tomorrow pick up i i just found another computer same price but its actually five dollars cheaper has a 450 watt power supply thats probably fine 4 gigs of ram so thats a slight improvement there 4 gigs around thats probably good enough and then any 8400 again kind of surprised he hasnt just tried to like leave and go into some little computer shop and get them to give him a deal because of who he is that was my full expectation the whole time and then he put up the rule that we cant use our influence i was like wow because thats exactly what i expect youre going to do mmhmm so now im not sure how hes gonna cheat i just know that hes going to you know what we should do is we should look really excited when we pull out and and we should look like were heading somewhere ok well give them a little little farewell beep beep you know i dont even know how to use craigslist first stop is going to be the salvation army thrift store this isnt a computer music how was bad that was really bad i hope lionesses time is not not going better i just throw the car under us and he will be ok we can afraid we could afford judgement at the end of the at the end of the contest when we have no computer because theres no computers at thrift shops and  magically found something on craigslist im hoping that they dont have like computer savvy employees so they might undervalue a certain tower compared to another one like that my price to them at the same price and one of them is actually clearly better fingers crossed music is this literally a clothing store now music hi hi im actually contacting a few guys that are selling computer parts may i ask which one dilbert uh yeah thats right hi im just generally looking for everything right now i dont have any of the components locked in and i need to get everything by about midday tomorrow its a birthday present what would we be looking at for something like a q 6600 and a bored still leaves me needing case power supply do you have any like super cheap oh stupid stuff yeah case and power supply okay im not worried about the case looking great he doesnt see real well music you know what look i will call you back before the end of your shop time today so ill call you back in the next hour or so and ill let you know if im gonna come by tomorrow morning and pick this stuff up sounds like this might be the deal that helps me out here all right thank you very much take care maybe it was worth while to listen to that life story after all we might have just gotten everything but a video card with a hundred dollar budget for a graphics card left over okay that might be like plus tax well lets hope its not i got an email back from the guy that i actually wanted to respond the most this was the guy with the 8400 that had four gigabytes of ddr3 as well and the 500 gigabyte hard drive its not the greatest price but thats an option hes available right now which is good so i need to figure out if i can get a what i can get for a graphics card for 220 bucks if i can get something good enough which i think i can i think ill go with it  mica yes i did okay i got it i got to be upfront with you i cant leverage being me as a negotiation strategy so you have to pretend that im not who i am so i dont need a watercooled card i need an aircooled card which means that since i i dont have any budget left over for the rest of the system i pretty much have to get an allinone liquid cooler for 100  whatever i pay for your card so thats where im at i have got no leads on an allinone liquid cooler and i have to have this done by the end of the day tomorrow is bear now israel i see that yeah can you do 80 okay can i pick it up can i pick it up today or tomorrow can i come tomorrow morning youre in richmond correct youre in burnaby i think im gonna be in burnaby anyway like im doing a bit of im doing a bit of computer hardware pick up stuff tomorrow so i will be ill be around so tell you what why dont you just pick somewhere somewhere safe near wherever it is you live like a starbucks or whatever and then just let me let me know youve got my number so if you just text me the address and what time works for you ill be there tomorrow morning okay all right thank you that would be no problem all right take care okay we have secured a gtx 580 for 80 if they can get a slightly faster cpu than us like maybe an 1155 core i5 quad core something along those lines even if they have a slightly lesser video card they might still come out ahead if they get a similar video card better cpu then were in real trouble but basically this is gonna i need to make sure our power supply has support for gtx 580 thats a pretty power hungry card hopefully spinning their wheels finding nothing all right so i got the computer everything works he booted it up for me i got to inspect everything its fine i didnt haggle him down anymore so i got it for 80 bucks which i think is fine well have to see what linus got but that seems like an okay deal for an 8400 computer to me the inside is really nice and clean so i was happy to see that it looks like he took good care of it or at least took good care of it right before i got there yeah not entirely sure which one but anyways kind of baller ram i didnt expect of it okay maybe not absolutely baller but its gold plated well not really gold plated gold painted ocz memory which i thought was kind of funny theres the e 8400 the fan cpu fan and everything is in immaculate condition which is great let me get this back in here one quick second i thought it was kind of funny the optical drive isnt even hooked up but i wouldnt use it anyway so the power supply though is kind of like the most sketchy balls thing ever its a power link 450 watt but yeah i dont know no pcie power whatsoever theres two molex as those so i can adapter off for that so i dont know were just gonna have to see so this will be my base platform ill see if i need to get a new power supply and then yeah this is really awkward because ive just made appointments with our gtx 580 watercooled card and our cooler for it which are totaling 100 but someone just accepted our offer for 100 on a 79 50 so im gonna do a little bit of research into overclocking the 580 and overclocking the 7950 but im gonna feel like a real bad dude but i might have to bail on those guys and take the better offer the problem is that now i have to go get it tonight which means i might have to take like the kids with me so save on select intel core i7 processors and 730 series ssds with instant rebates during valentines week february 14th to 21st 2015 click now to learn more so did we decide about going to get things tonight i cant well thats very interesting then i have a call to make music im not cheating replying to a message there wasnt okay i had to i had no i had to do other stuff ive been back here for a bit i had to like record a voiceover and stuff no have i been here have i been working wow dicks sorry i cant come down to get anything tonight so i might have to pass if anything changes i will i will give a call tomorrow to to let you know if it comes to that then if its not too much to ask maybe take the card out with you and i could come to you wherever you happen to be because its a bit of a scavenger hunt situation ive got going on thanks my number is 3 10 10 10 pizza hut good night there im done for the night there its all im doing tonight next time on scrapyard wars linus gets a tetanus shot luke gets mugged and nick fights a demon god none of that actually happens or does it

currently connected to the internet which means that we can instantly communicate with billions of other people all around the world whenever we want to but despite how much progress in technology the rest of the world we experience has made there still exists today hundreds of tribes consisting of thousands of people who live just like our ancient ancestors did 10000 years ago and many of them have no idea that the outside world our world exists most continents dont have anybody living on them who are completely unaware of modern civilization the last native american in the united states who lived most of his life completely removed from american culture was found in 1911 and the last uncontacted aboriginal huntergatherers in australia were found and contacted just in 1984 so theres only a handful of places left in the world where you can still find these uncontacted people a handful in the congo basin of africa a few on the andaman islands in the indian ocean and several on the pacific island of new guinea but by far the vast majority of uncontacted people remaining in the world 97 of them are currently living on the south american continent primarily in the deep dark and hard to get to parts of the amazon rainforest over a hundred tribes consisting of thousands of people have been living here generation after generation for thousands of years ever since humans first arrived on the continent roughly 15000 years ago but how can it be that so many of these people still dont know about our modern world the answer largely has to do with geography the amazon rainforest is enormous larger than the entire indian subcontinent but with a population under 20 million meaning that several cities across the world have more people than that the reason so few people live here is because really why would anybody want to its covered with extremely dense forests dangerous wildlife in his store klee has never really been developed by any modern civilization theres only one bridge across the entire length of the amazon river and the largest city in the region called manaus in brazil is primarily only accessible by boat where by plane the rest of the amazon interior is even more difficult to access so the uncontacted people who live here are both difficult to actually reach and its difficult for them to leave even if they wanted to the other reason why they still exist is because the governments of the countries whose territory they live in have decided to leave them alone and refrain from first contacts because previous attempts to contact isolated tribes has ended in catastrophe when europeans first started arriving in large numbers to the new world after columbuss discovery in 1492 80 to 95 of the indigenous population of the americas died within 150 years mostly due to diseases like measles and smallpox brought by the european conquerors the indigenous people who had lived for thousands of years separated from the rest of the world had not developed the immunities to disease as the europeans did by living sidebyside with animals like cattle and pigs when the europeans arrived the natives  no chance to the biological cancer that ravaged their continent and the surviving uncontacted tribes of today faced that exact same problem when encountering us a tribe in colombia for example was contacted a few decades ago by modern anthropologists but the tribes population was cut down to less than half its size simply because of diseases the anthropologists accidentally exposed them to in addition to that first encounters with isolated tribes can sometimes result in violence clashes and equador between uncontacted tribes and loggers cutting down the forests around them erupted in 2006 in 2007 that left 30 tribes people and ten loggers dead loggers oil prospectors drug traffickers and hunters all occasionally stumble upon an uncontacted tribe in the jungle by accident still today and the resulting encounters can obviously end up being pretty tense theres a man who lives in the amazon in brazil called the loneliest man in the world an indigenous uncontacted man who lives alone and is believed to be the last surviving member of his tribe the language he speaks is unknown as is the name of the tribe he once belonged to and his existence first became known about in 1996 the brazilian government sent numerous expeditions to find him that all failed until 2007 and when they finally encountered him he shot one of them in the chest with a bow and arrow later evidence found what was believed to be his old village bulldozed and destroyed by illegal loggers or settlers after this incident the brazilian government declared a 42 square mile exclusion zone around him thats illegal for anybody to trespass into hes the only human that exists in that entire area and its illegal for anybody to visit him and hes still there because video was taken of him this year in 2018 cutting down a tree the brazilian government maintains a policy today of zero contact with uncontacted peoples but maintains occasional flyovers to check up on their numbers and how theyre doing which can yield some incredible photographs like these we can only speculate about what these people must be thinking at the sight of seeing an airplane flying above them but imagine for a moment if earth was considered an uncontacted area by some advanced alien species they may treat us the same way that we treat our uncontacted peoples we limit our contact out of respect for their own safety but maintain occasional flyovers for checkups and to satisfy our own curiosity curiosity about the unknown is always fascinating to humans its just part of what makes us who we are

__label__1 its time for our oh dear it reboot so many challengers approached only three were successful in this is one of them charlie say hi hi hi internet hi mom hi dad no no your dads over there so charlie hales to us from where you from man florida oh oh wow so you were right in the heart of it yeah so you have power to go plug this into right well we have powers not my favorite wow all right well thats pretty lucky man well everybody you know safe and cool yes rock on glad to hear that okay so today were gonna be building a rocking machine have you ever built a computer before no no this is your first time yeah well today that changes welcome to the party lets get started so what do you want to start with motherboard good choice so even though youve never built a computer before if you watched a build god yeah a lot of them all guaymas tech tips guides right no have you at least watched a linus tech tips guide yeah i make a very minimal oh wow so thats the kind of video were makin all right shots fired shots hit the target lets all just wipe up our tshirts and convince you oh holy crap corsair yeah your system at home you were the one with the laptop right yeah super bowl and laptop thats great for gaming no no not so much hey my computer is an hp laptop its a my little laptop and then right next to it i got my little twenty five dollar mouse i dont actually know what brand my mouse is i kind of got it cuz it wasnt really expensive pretty much no really you had like a pentium core with hd into integrated graphics and tell me something hd intel graphics how high definition are they 720p is good yeah thats what theyd like you to think okay have you ever installed the cpu before no all right touched one okay so here not yet okay you can touch it no just kidding okay you can touch it it not alright so you want to line that up real carefully theres no force required so all you get to do there you go that was it alright push them down lower the arm down you have officially installed the cpu yeah okay have you done ran before i mean i took grandmothers i get all the computer fantastic all right lets do it why am i even here cuz i dont know everything ive memorized how do you do the motherboard and thats pretty much where it is haha so tell me then charlie what was your plan if somebody ever did give you a computer worth of parts you were just gonna assemble the motherboard and kind of i just go on youtube and watch a guide and filled it with that youve got all the answer kids today man so tell me something charlie whats gonna be the first thing you do when the system arrives at home message the rgb and then im gonna go to the steam floor and by a games really good graphics so that i can see those im just repeating for the sake of thoroughness we could pull the board out we could relocate this standoff we could put it there mmm heres a tim boetsch work wait stop we missed something really important oh no you didnt do the satisfying plastic peel off the ram enjoy this i only get to do it once oh yes look how shiny it is now we also have to figure out where our hard drive is gonna go because this hard drive cage can you say whos good up here i did say that but let me tell you something about adults charlie sometimes well they dont lie but they say things without having really thought them through kids your age allowed to use knives yeah yeah okay dont your side i dont know mine are like 5 and 3 so all right now leave these fans because i have something better rgb fans its gonna be lit thats what the kids say right yeah when that rgb lighting is giving you an extra 15 frames per second youll thank me i tell you man it is so easy to build a computer these days and like have it look awesome concurrent to a thousand years ago i can imagine your side since thousand years you go to go to computer youre sure your name is charlie yeah sure its not alec oh im gonna confess something to you charlie mr i know so how come you picked an amd build because i like to rosenbear plus it feels like to actually care about prices even when hes not paying for it hes going for the perception of whos treating the customer more fairly so you said this machine is for gaming at school so surely 480 gigs on your boot drive is not enough for the library you want okay well thats fine weve got you covered 2 terabyte drive then you got to make a big decision here possibly the most important decision of the entire build do you want to put it on the bottom or the top is there really a difference no hey theres two on the other side then we need that sata data cable that we set aside much much earlier and then misplaced and then found go for it open it up enjoy it savor it so i ripped it those are all the good vibes again see i used to wonder why people watch unboxing videos then i watched an amateur open a box totally get it now oh theres cool on top yeah thats a cool logo this isnt just any oh yeah this is a strix 1080 ti wow there it is thats whats gonna run all your mind crafts and there are neopets believe it or not it works as cool as it looks if you were to run cheapo games like minecraft on it believe it or not these fans these fans wouldnt even have to spin wow because the heatsink on it is so big this thing has like the entire thing basically covered in aluminum fins okay now the most important part of installing the graphics card not dropping it okay okay the next important oh yes its got a typo on it i think hey really look at this gtx 10 80 ti gaming its kind of embarrassed its not gaming its like its like gaming yo so line up your ports at the back hey you can tell if these are yep youre good did it i just autograph this card sure did and you started with the best graphics card now this is cool your graphics card actually includes an rgb lighting header so we can hook one of our rgb lighting strips that we have from cable mod up to it okay alright cover your eyes okay just follow up follow us out of my voice okay okay this is the time for the big reveal dont trip over that big block in front of your foot no im just kidding theres no block because i moved it turn to the right and experience 180 hertz gaming so that is what high refresh rate with gsync looks like so however many frames your gpu spits out thats exactly how many frames get displayed here so you dont see any tearing you dont see any lag so you dont even have to give kids these days a game theyll just play move the window around if you throw a high enough refresh rate monitor at those now let me show you something else thats really cool come around this side thats nice rgb yeah thats a nice rgb and and well get the utility loaded up but check this out see this rgb logo here and the logo on the back of the graphics card its synchronized with the rgb strip across the top here i got one other cool thing for you to really listen to it thats going that stinks for you well family wont get annoyed at all well im sure theyll find reasons to get annoyed because youre always gonna be on the computer or bugging them to go on the computer the day was awesome actually it was really cool the bill was my hair part and then it was also fun at the end too test the computer and stuff i was definitely not expecting a 1080i so while charlie plays around with the rgb settings on the video card which also controls the rgb strip along the top i guess ill bid you guys farewell thanks for watching this episode of our rog rig reboot huge congratulations to you bud for winning this whole thing rate the system you go tell me out of 10 10 10 out of 10 perfect i like your style man alright thanks for watching guys
__label__1 lg hasnt had the best year when it comes to smartphones despite some innovative ideas its g5 was not exactly wellreceived but lg has more than one smartphone line and the newest in the v series has more than a few tricks under its unassuming shell from fifa 2016 in berlin im michael fisher with some first impressions of the lg v 20 music at first glance the v20 doesnt seem too remarkable the colors are safe the shape is safe its a very conservative design compared to last years blend of shiny steel and colorful rubber on the one hand i like it i always thought the v10 looked a little confused with its mix of materials and the mostly aluminum v20 offers a comparatively consistent aesthetic also while its not waterproof it does feature the same durability rating as the v10 on the other hand the vseries is supposed to be lgs extreme phone and this design doesnt even hint in it its crazy capabilities i guess i just wanted something more memorable lg comes through for the target audience of power users though push a button on the side and youll see that the b20 offers the increasingly rare removable battery also theres microsd expansion for beefing up the onboard storage and the phone is built on a foundation of specs solid enough for all but the most extreme users and its not just a scattershot spec dump as with the v10 the v20 is all about optics and audio on the back two cameras sit side by side one for wideangle shots and the other for high resolution ones if the phone works as claimed you should get some of the steadiest videos around with the v 20 because it uses a new blend of optical and digital stabilization as well as a hybrid focus system that uses laser ranging phase detection and contrast detection now all that tech talk word salad means you should be able to focus faster and in more conditions youve also got manual controls for everything under the sun as well as a bunch of film effects to spruce up your shots up front theres just a single selfie camera this year but it is wideangle and lg says its 34 brighter than last years as for audio youd probably have to buy sonys 3000 walkman to find more audiophile friendly features in a portable device most of this is lost on me frankly but one thing really stood out to me lg has improved the aop of its microphones this year that means the v20 should be able to record clearly in extremely loud environments which might make this your new concert camcorder if youre one of those hosers who ruins my view it shows with your cell phone oh but important that bang  olufsen branding you see dont get too excited about it if youre in the us that custom tuning will not be available in the north american version finally the v 20 is the first flagship shipping with android n out of the box and its improvements are welcome lgs software scan is less so but at least i didnt detect much lag or stutter in my brief time with the device lg claims nougats power management will give the v20 20 better battery life than the v10 despite having only about a 7 larger power pack and yep this secondary display is back the little ticker panel is almost twice as bright and features better contrast than last years but honestly i still think its in the wrong place i found this big and extra screen should be at the bottom if you ask me with the b20 lg has stuck to an existing formula instead of reinventing the wheel well see if it pays off and whether another smartphone for av aficionados has a place in the market when it goes on sale later this year
__label__1 routing backtracking to memphis but fedexs most ingenious hub is here in
__label__1 let me say this upfront i hate putting a question in a headline too often its used as a cheap shortcut for easy clicks but in this case its not just an appropriate question its the most important one this is the san heiser pxe 550 and its one of the more expensive travel headsets you can buy what i want to know is is it better than the bose qc25 the headset ive used as the benchmark for quality in 2016 im mister mobile lets find out music sahn hyzers reputation for quality is keenly reflected in this headset once you get past the flimsy carrying case thats not quite as nice as the one you get from bose the cans themselves are excellently made with black plastic done up in soft touch paint and framed by metal accents the 550 looks fancier than the qc 35 its adjustable headband sliders feel better made and theres a tech bonus to the right side earpiece plays host to a touchpad that lets you control volume and track selection with a series of swipes also theres no humdrum power button instead you turn the 550 off and on by twisting the cans to theyre stowed or deployed position it takes some getting used to but after a while once you get into the flow the coolness outweighs the slight inconvenience in terms of battery life the headset will last you about as long as the bose will which is to say forever ive used it on trains buses cars planes and unbox tube every dunkin donuts in between and the only times the headset has fallen short of its 30 hour battery claim other times i forget to turn them off you got to get used to stowing them properly when you want to save juice because as far as i can tell there is no automatic power off and how does it sound tremendous remember how blown away i was by the acoustic noise cancellation on the qc 35 the 550 is almost if not just as good and its smarter to the cap tune app for android and ios lets you adjust how intense that noise cancellation is it tells you things like battery level and what sound mode youre in and it gives you an eq with some presets to play around with though those will only work on locally stored media now if you want you can adjust the effect mode right on the headphones with the tap of a button those work with all audio and your options are club movie speech or off i prefer the latter the 550 kicks out nice even sound without the need of any audio effects so whats bad about it well that damn wind problem is no better on the sun heiser than on the boughs where these in a stiff breeze and the air over the microphones will make you feel like someones blowing in your ear and not in a good way also the headset is a little less flexible tighter on the head than some others and the otherwise lovely computer voice calls everything a phone even if you pair it to a laptop or a tablet phone one connected oh speaking of phone calls i dont really like them on noise cancelling headsets i think the artificial side tone makes everyone sound far away and the experience here isnt much different callers also said my voice quality on their end wasnt particularly good if there was any kind of background noise are those downsides enough to bring down the 550 not at all look its expensive even more so than they already pricy qc 35 but to my ear it equals or exceeds the bose product in nearly every category now in terms of overall comfort i still have to give the point to the qc 35 then if i were choosing between the two id still go for the bose to save a few bucks and for the additional decibel or two in noise cancellation but the 550 gets so much right in such a classy package that i cant give it anything but a thumbsup if you travel a ton and youve got the cash snap these up you probably wont regret it ive reviewed almost as many headsets as smartphones in 2016 so if youre in the market for something less expensive more flashy or just plain insane
__label__1 the razor blade has been a rollercoaster of emotions for me over the years with the highest peak being when i dropped a crap ton of cash on them for my staff and the biggest valley being shortly afterward the defect rate of the aforementioned blades that i bought for my staff now the most recent last gen blade was fine in fact weve got two units that are both still working like the day we got them but it was such a boring pure spec update that honestly i was having a hard time figuring out what the heck razor has been working on for the last few years fortunately all of that changes today this is the blade 2018 and  once i got over the shock of razor moving to kind of a a boxier design compared to their older curvy one my initial impressions of the razor blade 2018 are actually very positive the aluminum chassis is extremely rigid in spite of its overall slimness and the significant reduction in bezel size makes it feel far more 2018 then its not so 2018 predecessors probably the most important change to the id here though is that razor has finally made a laptop that will impress both your gaming friends and your business associates that is assuming of course that you do get at least a little bit of help from debrand and maybe tone down the rgb on the keyboard so it has hdmi mini displayport and usb typec along with three fullsized usb taipeis and that type see i showed you thats a thunderbolt 3 port very nice not to mention its got significantly better performance so its core i7 8750 age and gtx 1070 maxq might seem a little pedestrian compared to other manufacturers who have been bitten by the core i9 bug but as weve seen over the last couple of weeks unless youre building a machine like this one you can actually end up better off with a less powerful cpu but one that you can actually cool compared to an opie one that ends up throttling all day so were gonna fire up an i264 test here and were gonna see that while the 2018 does actually trade some clock speed for thermals when hit with a synthetic load so you can see here its running at 26 gigahertz for a short while then its gonna drop down to our base of 22 gigahertz in games this thing regularly turbos up to 4 gigahertz ending up in about the 90 degrees range and never thermal throttled in our 24 degrees celsius office and our gpu stayed nice and cool in the low 70s and as you see here im gonna lean in close to it the finns are certainly audible but not distracting at all and what else is cool is that this generation blade keeps the keyboard nice and cool even while gaming though it should be noted that this area right here right above the keyboard thats where your heatsink is you are not going to want to touch that now performance is right about where we expect it with the 1070 maxq getting beaten but even then only slightly by the fullfat gtx 1070 in the asus zephyrus what linus you might say what i really loved about the old blade was how loud it was huh if youre not concerned gamer im just gonna fire up synapse here all you have to do is enter gaming mode which actually boosts up the clock speed here we go of our gtx 1070 max q takes the cpus tdp from 35 to 45 watts with a max turbo power of 85 watts and generally makes the blade 2018 a worse laptop if you were blindfolded in gaming mode with the blade 2018 in front of you wed forgive you if you mistook your gaming rig for a drone taking off we would actually recommend leaving gaming mode off until razer provides maybe some finer control of the power and fan profiles because the performance gain is in our estimation not really worth it now on the subject of options that gamers should actually use the 144 hertz 1080p version of this notebook is the one to get you can completely ignore the 60 hertz 4k version unless you desperately need a touch screen 1080p 144 hertz is a perfect fit for this cpu gpu combo and the ips panel in this version is bright and vivid with the high refresh memory making everything from games to even just messing around on the desktop navigating windows feel and more responsive i think the only thing that i would like to see added in razors options is a touch version of the 1080p one because right now theyre really making you choose between the ultimate compact gaming laptop and one that is still optimal for productivity though this might be something that we have to take up with the actual panel manufacturers and not so much with razer now above the screen here is the webcam pretty decent compared to other laptop webcams which is to say that it is still behind literally every flagship phone on the market and we really wish that laptop makers other than microsoft i guess would be the only one that seems to be taking it seriously still bad we wish they would start doing a better job given how small of a camera element you can have and how inexpensive a camera element you can have that can end up with a very nicelooking image these days with that said at least razer borrowed some of its mobile expertise on the speakers for this puppy they do lack a little bit of punch on the low end but they make up for it with clear sound that is pretty loud and excellent stereo separation music music now back to the bit that we talked about before about how this machine could easily be used for gaming and productivity what about the keyboard now razer keyboards have been a real sticking point between me and alex who has kind of become our defacto notebook editor now i have liked most of razors notebook keyboards with the notable exception being the blade pro key on the other hand literally changed my personal blade stealth desktop background to this when he had to use it for like an hour now fortunately razer has actually made some revisions to the keyboard in this model and we can finally agree its very good its got a nice snappy feel to the keystrokes its not too loud and we both feel comfortable typing on this machine for hours then below that very satisfactory keyboard is one of the biggest touch pads that i have ever seen on a windows machine in fact it it might be the biggest one like check this thing out it is awesome to use like it baffles me that it has been two years since the apple macbook pro 2016 and no one has ripped off that design yet like its still not quite as good as the one on the macbook pro but with its glass top really nice feel nice clicky buttons although not the whole surface is clickable its the closest that weve seen in a windows machine opening up the blade 2018 reveals actually pretty impressive upgrade ability given its size both the ram thats a new one and the storage can be easily swapped and that is a hacking impressive 80 watt hour battery that gives it four hours of life in our pc mark test now thats not an amazing result compared to other productivity centric notebooks but it absolutely smashes other gaming laptops that are this powerful bringing us to the price our model here comes in at 2400 us dollars which is considerably more than the asus eris but im going to put next to a right here and remember guys this is a laptop that already had a substantial thin tax built into the toll that it was gonna take on your wallet if youre gonna be gaming day and night we feel that the zephyrus is a better choice it offers a bit more performance while making less noise it has more room for games thanks to its hard drive in addition to its ssd and it offers silky smooth visuals thanks to gsync by contrast the blade is still very competent for gaming and crushes the zephyrus when youre on the go thanks to its more professional looks excellent trackpad smaller form factor and double the battery life but of course you get to pay a thinness tax and a razor tax

__label__1 if we find aliens what do we do next when discussing first contact many are quick to point out that historically contact between culturally different civilizations has almost always led to the destruction of one of those civilizations because of this you could argue that we should stick to ourselves leave the aliens alone but in almost every one of those historical examples its the civilization that makes contact that destroys the civilization that receives contact so perhaps we should go on the offensive find the aliens before they find us of course weve been trying for decades to find extraterrestrial life its one of humanitys great questions are we alone one way we might find aliens is by looking at stars or more specifically the light level of stars as the earth has developed our energy consumption has skyrocketed thats just the consequence of an increasingly technologically advanced world its suspected that this trend will continue and its also suspected that with any alien civilization theyll also require more and more energy as they advance eventually any planetary civilization will reach a point where the amount of energy on their planet is not enough to sustain their advancing civilization theoretical physicist freeman dyson speculated that when a planetary civilization needs more energy than their planet can provide theyll turn to the sun stars are the most abundant source of energy in any planetary system so a super advanced civilization could build a series of satellites to orbit around their sun to collect energy when sunlight travels through space it loses energy until the amount of energy captured by a solar panel near the sun would be astronomically higher than a solar panel on earth with more energy as civilization could produce more satellites and eventually there would be a swarm of satellites orbiting the sun freeman dyson believes that this is the most logical way that any civilization would harvest the energy they need so if we search for a star with orbiting satellites we might be able to find an alien civilization no telescope is powerful enough to see the individual satellites but we can rather easily observe the light level of stars you see once a faraway civilization building satellites the swarm will start to block our view of their son as the satellites orbit from our perspective it will look like this star is twinkling something completely unnatural so by looking for stars with highly variable light levels we might be able to find an alien civilization harvesting the energy of their sun kic eight four six two eight five two also known as tabby star is a star in the cygnus constellation of the milky way scientists observe the light level of this star for years and they regularly came across irregularities like this maybe there are comments or a debris field obstructing our view of this star but astronomers have doubted that either of those could dip the light levels by this much this has led some to suggest that an alien civilization has built these orbiting satellites around their sun but we may never know for certain of course all of this is somewhat speculative and its unlikely that wed actually find a socalled dyson sphere around a sun its more of a thought experiment demonstrating that we could find aliens through looking for their impact on the universe conversely aliens might find us based on our effect on the universe thats why we very purposely sent out messages to our hypothetical cosmic neighbors the pioneer plaques were designed and placed on the to pioneer spacecrafts which were the first to explore the far reaches of the solar system since these two are some of the farthest manmade objects from earth they were sent with a message in case extraterrestrials come across the probes this is what was sent the pioneer plaque it has a representation of hydrogen the most abundant element in the universe a picture of a man and woman including a raised hand a gesture that most likely wouldnt be understood but shows how our limbs move and the existence of the opposable thumb an image of the pioneer spacecraft behind the humans so that the extraterrestrials could figure out the rough size of humans the location of the sun relative to 14 nearby pulsar stars using hydrogen spin flip transition frequency as the unit something far too complicated for me to explain and lastly an image of the solar system with the rough trajectory of the pioneer spacecraft but there are issues with this image we have no idea how aliens gather information humans are a visual species since we have relatively good vision so its natural for us to convey information through images aliens on the other hand could have poor or no vision and therefore no conception of the idea of transferring information through images or they could interpret the symbols vastly differently perhaps the most frequently criticized aspect of the plaque is the arrow its believed that the arrow symbol is derived from either the shape of arrows or the human hand pointing or perhaps a combination of both aliens would most likely have neither arrows or hands and therefore no idea what this symbol means they could also make the dangerous assumption that the symbol depicts a weapon launching meaning that the spacecraft was sent to harm them other sets of images have been sent with subsequent space probes but the chance of aliens finding these few tiny objects in the vastness of space is miniscule whats far more likely is that aliens will discover humanity off of something weve been sending out for over a hundred years radio signals while most are too weak to reach faraway galaxies some do travel through space and could be picked up by extraterrestrial civilizations especially more advanced ones with better detection technology than us its entirely possible that weve already unintentionally sent the signal that will be our first message to an extraterrestrial civilization its also entirely possible that the first sign we will have of extraterrestrial life is a radio message from another planet the problem is then deciphering it the first step is deciding what the message even is is a binary is a radiation is a natural language what is it we can figure this out in the english language the most common word the accounts for about seven percent of all word occurrences the second most common word e accounts for about 35 percent of all words then and is about 23 percent and so on and so forth the distribution of words it turns out in all languages follows a logarithmic scale the second most common word occurs about half as frequently as the most common the third 13 is often the fourth one fourth is often the fifth one fifth is often and so on and so forth this is somehow true for all languages e with no common ancestral language which means that more than likely an alien language will follow the same distribution its not entirely understood why languages follow this distribution but one possible explanation is that people are lazy its called a principle of least effort people animals even machines will always pick the path of least resistance the easiest path and in the case of language the meaning that needs to be most frequently conveyed will be attached to the most common word rather than a number of other words since that is easiest that keeps happening down to the least frequent word therefore creating this distribution with an extraterrestrial transmission if we rank the sounds by frequency and it follows this distribution we can believe that its most likely a language but then we need to try to understand the language for this we need to drop all assumptions there are innate similarities across all human languages mostly related to grammar for example pretty much every language separates description words nouns from action words verbs grammatically there are huge similarities between all languages even ones that develop separately some have suggested that this means that humans have a genetic framework for language perhaps we are hardwired from birth to understand what nouns and verbs and sentences are and learning a language is just the process of filling in and understanding that framework from everything we understand about the communication systems that animals use they do not have a universal grammar like humans we therefore have to assume that an alien language would be fundamentally different than ours we dont know how those structure sentences we dont even know if theyll have sentences the problem is if we just receive a natural language transmission theres really nothing we can do when deciphering ancient languages linguist figure out meaning using context and relations to other languages but with an alien language transmission there is no context and no other similar languages to compare it with all this is assuming that aliens use a verbal language and thats a huge assumption many if not most animals have no verbal communication system fish and chameleons alter their body color to communicate while ants and honeybees use pheromones to talk to other members of their species even if we understood their language could we understand what theyre saying take this sentence in french translating it literally wordforword gets you the palace verb on is the name commonly given to the building that houses the assembly national french located on the kiev or say in the seventh borough of paris of the square of the concorde even if you clean it up to a structure it like an english sentence how much meaning is conveyed to you what exactly is the french national assembly where is the chi of or say where is the seventh borough where is concorde square someone familiar to paris and france would understand what these words mean but someone from the other side of the world would infer little meaning from them philosopher ludwig wittgenstein famously wrote if a lion could speak we would not be able to understand him language is all based on cultures and requires a common frame of reference if you said im taking an uber to get some coffee at starbucks theres no way it would understand what youre saying you have to explain what uber is then explain what a car is what the internet is what a phone is an app coffee starbucks stores the monetary system all stuff that is intuitive to modern humans translating the words of an extraterrestrial civilization is just the first step understanding what theyre saying is the more difficult task centuries or millennia after detecting aliens we might reach a day when an extraterrestrial being comes to earth if this happens the alien civilization is almost certainly more advanced than humans since it has accomplished interstellar travel and perhaps even faster than light travel but we want to show that us humans are intelligent as well of course the et would see everything that humans have built but they might interpret the structures of mankind as natural phenomenons we cant assume that they think that buildings and cars and artificial light are not part of a natural structure of earth we therefore need to show them that we have at least a basic understanding of the universe math as far as we know is universal no matter where you go or who you ask 2 plus 2 is 4 and the ratio of a circles circumference to diameter is 314159 2 and so on and so forth of course what you call two or four or pi would be different but the concepts are the same therefore we could show the aliens our understanding of math put 2 then 2  4 4  4 then 8 keep this going until they get the point although perhaps the best mathematical principle to demonstrate would be the pythagorean theorem its complicated but easy to show the pythagorean theorem of course demonstrates that in the case of a right triangle the square of the side opposite to the right angle is equal to the square of the other two sides combined in an equation that reads a squared plus b squared equals c squared visually we can demonstrate this by drawing squares on the two shorter sides out of smaller squares and show how the amount of squares on the two sides equals the amount of squares on the longer side showing this theorem cements that humans do understand how the mathematical aspect of our universe works even though were less advanced than the aliens so now that weve found the aliens now that we have met them we can talk to them someone needs to speak first but lets say was you lets say you were given the chance to ask the first question from humanity to an extraterrestrial being you became the first point of contact between humanity and the universe what would you ask

__label__1 so theres this fantastic wikipedia list descriptively titled wikipedia  unusual articles i just remembered as that wikipedia list its a collection of hundreds of articles about unusual unexpected and unbelievable subjects no matter what link you click its bound to be interesting for that reason every week im going to click on a new link and teach you a little bit more about our amazing world maps are very hard to make to create a map from scratch 1s two years of fieldwork er analyzation of satellite photos so plagiarism has always been rampant among map makers its pretty easy just to redraw the same geographical features from one map on to a new map and its hard to get caught you are after all drawing the exact same world so map makers came up with a way to catch individuals stealing their data this is argyll tynin west lancashire england according to a 2009 screenshot of google maps argyll tin is a town its supposedly located between autumn to the south and ormskirk to the north the problem is if you go to this site this is what you find the argyll tenue paper towns are fake places that are put on maps as copyright traps a map maker can make up a place and if they see that a competing map maker also has that town on their maps they know that at one point the competitor plagiarized their info so in argyll tains case the town probably wasnt placed there by google google gets their data from tella atlas who sources their data from other mapping companies who in turn get some of their data from other mapping companies somewhere down the line someone must have place argyll tanaan the map as a trap and its presence on google maps was just a remnant of that after the fake town gained widespread media attention who were removed it from their map and it has since been replaced with a marker designating the spot as a ghost town there are hundreds of other examples of paper towns in new york a spot north of roscoe new york was marked as the town of aglow by the general drafting company in 1930 the name came from an anagram of the cartographers initials and appeared on numerous maps since its conception in the 1960s a glow showed up on a ranma canali map of the region and thinking they had fallen into their trap esso who had bought the map from the general drafting company threatened to sue mcnally the suit was dropped though when rand mcnally pointing that aglow had actually become a real place sometime in the 1950s locals opened up a general store north of roscoe new york and after looking at an esso map of the region decided to call their store the aglow general store there for making a glow an official place the store eventually went out of business and the town is censuses appear for most maps but this is one instance where a fake town real a similar idea of paper towns has been used in other domains in 2001 the word equivalents appeared in the new oxford american dictionary defined as the willful avoidance of ones official responsibilities that word was made up as a copyright trap and it actually worked dictionarycom and gules dictionary both added a listing for the word equivalents possibly proving a level of plagiarism among the online dictionaries occasionally unintentional traps are created that prove effective before they created apple maps apple was making maps on a much smaller scale for iphoto these maps had no attributions and therefore no one could be sure where their data was from but there were some obvious clues this screenshot of apples map of norwich shows an area of disorganized roads in the northeast if you look at the openstreetmap map of the area you can see that these rows are actually trails in a park overlaying the apple map over the osm map of the area you can see how perfectly the suppose it road and trails line up you can assume from this that apple took their map data from open street map and mistook the trails for roads a few months after the release apple officially credit open street map for their contributions to the maps confirming that they use osms data so those are paper towns i hope you enjoyed this weeks episode ill be back next week to bring you more from that wikipedia list

__label__0 let me know what you think of fitbits latest efforts versa and ionic in the comments below until next time thanks for watching and stay mobile my friends
__label__1 we are going to liquid cool all five of our editing workstations together so those are like core i7 six cores and gtx titans then were gonna take that water were gonna dig it out of the building and then were gonna put that on a massive radiator so were actually taking all that heat and dissipating it outside causing not only our systems to run cooler but also our room in which we do our work to be cooler well the whole actual goal of the whole room water cooling project was to cool down the room where you could have done a much cheaper and easy solution of actually installing a like a seat unit but instead weve decided to go along with this how effective will it actually be not hugely but hopefully itll help a little bit and be really clean sant one system in particular was the main inspiration for this project and thats ed zoes machine which had a couple of problems number one is that the system itself was always overheating because he always had his six core processor pinned at a hundred percent so they were kicking out a bunch of heat into his quite inadequate cpu cooler which was then not keeping his cpu cool enough so problem number one was that his system was actually overheating so much like 8090 sometimes even above 90 degrees but it was thermal throttling and he wasnt even getting all the performance out of it and then problem number two was that the person sitting in front of it was constantly complaining about the heat in the room so with the whole room water cooling setup we can cool a system make it more powerful because we got a 12 core xeon for it and make that person complain less by making the room cooler you know originally i hadnt planned to paint the room the project is gonna be much smaller scale and i was gonna be just about liquid cooling the machines but i realized that if were gonna take the room apart clean it up presumably and pull all the systems out of it well this is a great opportunity to take it from a place where we all sit at our computers and work and turn that into like a really cool workspace that really feels like  tech tips make it feel like like home and like place thats really cool to be and work on our craft in the hot its a lot thats why what look at thats on the side yeah fortunately really oh my god yeah this is terrible so i drew upon my experience painting houses and training painters to get that done in kind of a linus tech tips gray and then as much as ive got a fair bit of painting experience im a little bit rusty and i have some experience training people who have never painted before but nick has really never painted before keeping the quality level up was a bit of a challenge as well nick did his best though and between the two of us we managed to get the whole job done although by the second coat i did pretty much most of it myself since it was you know the second coat is when you clean up the mistakes from the first coat a lot of the time finishing the first coat of paint was really nice i was able to put down the roller and kind of step back and go yeah this is starting to look really cool and i wanted to kind of turn to my sides and say hey guys dont you think this is great but i realized everyone was gone so i wandered downstairs and found out that while i was painting instead of everyone else kind of proactively figuring out how we can move the project forward they were doing arts and crafts and making a shield for luke and pinning buttons to turn his shirt into like impala button and armor all that might have been okay at least they had done a decent job of thinking i am cleaning over everyones old drives so that when they get their new computers itll be like using the same drive so brandon can have his viruses which he refused to take care of terry can have all his slow unoptimized drives and everything and we dont have to reinstall anything or waste any time freaking taryn this whole time has been telling me that system and that his slow boot is unrelated thats terrans drive i wonder what the slowness of his computers been about dammit im having a pile of like cases and graphics cards and i mean even the water cooling gear alone was a pile like having this mountain of a hardware that was actually at like as tall as me was really made me better understand the scope of what we were undertaking so apparently the project was pushed up a day i actually had no idea was not told by anyone but that seems to kind of be a lioness media group thing theres like you have to do this at some point in time somehow no one knows no ones gonna be helping you and were not really sure when but you wont have enough time so just make sure you do it really quickly like this actually gets finished before we move on to something else well it turned out linus didnt actually check the specs for the radiators before he bought them so when i tried to mount it on the top theres fittings that would be on the bottom of it that then pressed against the top of the case so i put it up on an angle and you couldnt actually get screws all the way through the fan the top of this case and past the fitting and into the radiator so i had to drill holes in the top which was fantastic thank you thank you please so luke actually ended up having to drill holes for each of the radiators before we could even start assembling the systems that took up a ton of his time that otherwise he would have been able to spend helping me build systems it got to the point where we actually had to recruit ezell to help us build computers even though his system building experience is not really that much hey it was pretty nice to me thanks no one was mostly painless the next one should be the second involvement all right and then it was pretty much time to water cool the systems something that i ended up doing the vast majority of myself so thats getting the tubing on the fittings for the cpu and gpu block running it outside of the case and then at that point i handed them off to ed who was the one who actually figured out how the fittings worked for the pic disconnects to install the the quick disconnects at the back on both the top radiator as well as the tubing coming out of the inside of the case installing everything in the systems was a monumental task and everyone had to chip in in ways that they havent really done before i even had edsel helping me assemble gpu water blocks onto the titan cards because that can be very timeconsuming and i needed to move on to the next thing that i could do when luke was drilling holes in cases so we had to parallelize the workflow a lot just to account for how timeconsuming everything was going to be well because im the plumber i deal with this sort of situation of soldering copper together and dealing with pex lines and different fittings for myself i would say maybe a to the typical homeowner or person that would try to tackle this on themselves would probably be closer to eight or nine maybe even a titch higher it all depends on your skill levels this project after i understood what they were wanting i thought it was a very interesting project music these are all what you called dry fat just to see if everything fits in the right places well and well hold it up like that solder it then these are all three inches apart three inches apart nice and neat so we got the vinyl decals in and theyre actually pretty big huge almost lifesize for linus it is lifesize we had to pay some guy in the parking lot oh three years yeah i was just doing the exiting i think a little bit of confusion was bound to happen and i think overall were a little confused music
__label__1 everybodys heard of mdot  ssds these little tiny doodads that manage to be many times smaller and many times faster than traditional computer hard drives or even regular sata ssds but there is understandably a ton of confusion that exists around how to choose one and install it in your existing system so lets figure that out shall we if you havent seen nerd sports yet check it out all the episodes are available now for free over at youtubecom slash channel super fun before we get started though we need to differentiate between physical standards and protocol standards this right here is a mini displayport cable and this right here is a thunderbolt cable but they look the same this usb typec port is running at usb 20 speeds this one is usb 3 which can be 10 or even 20 times the speed and this one is thunderbolt 3 which is faster still and comes with a host of other capabilities so backing up them because most cables are just a physical electrically conductive wire connecting point a to point b nothing would prevent a you know piece of coat hanger from connecting between a receiver and a home theater speaker or lets say an ethernet cable from being used to carry an hdmi diddle video signal in fact that product exists okay but back to computer drives again n dot 2 is one of several physical connector standards that allows an ssd to be attached internally to your computer this motherboard right here conveniently gives us a great example of all of them so what youre looking at right now is theta or serial ata this connector suffers from more latency because of its indirect connection to the cpu right here is the basically dead sata express standard that uses two pcie lanes which are better because theyre connected more directly to the cpu but has a very bulky connector and no drive support to speak of this one right here is u dot two which uses four pcie lanes twice as many as sata express but has all but disappeared outside the enterprise space and finally this one right here is n dot two which has basically one out versus the other nextgen connectors at this point thanks to its performance it also uses a maximum of four pcie lanes as well as its compact form factor that allows it to be used not just for desktops but also for ultrathin notebooks but and getting back to the whole lesson on protocol versus physical standards most of these physical connections support multiple protocols that is to say more than one way for the computer to communicate with the drives controller over the physical wires and if you arent using an nvme protocol drive in your mdot 2 slot you might not be getting the full experience so if your computer has a pcie mdot 2 slot and you can see the difference here between an nvme capable one and an ahd i only one here theyre usually labeled then its simple you just plug it in maybe configure a couple settings in the bios and poof its off to the races but then what if you dont have a pci express mdot to file on your motherboard ok well step one make sure you dont have one some motherboards even hide this connector on the back and its small enough that it can be pretty easy to miss then step 2 ensure that your motherboard actually supports booting to an nvme drive in general anything z97 or x99 chipset and newer will have that support and if it does and you still want to use a drive then you want to pick up one of these little guys these cards plug into a pcie slot on your motherboard just like a video card sound card etc consult your motherboards manual to find out how many lanes each slot has and what speeds they operate at more is better and ive got a couple different versions here silverstone has an nvme only one and one that supports both an nvme and a hci remember thats the same protocol as theta over a slightly different m2 connector that are reasonably priced then there are more premium options like the wings from angel bird that looks a little cooler and includes a thermal shield and pad to keep the drive from overheating were going to use this sp 505 and controller based nvme ssd from corsair for our demo here once everything is hooked up you can move the mounting screw around depending on the length of your nvme drive and then you just need to make sure youre running the latest uefi bios on your board and go through the same steps as our previous board that supported it natively going back further than the last couple generations of boards things get a little dicey theoretically all the way back to p 67 days you can install an nvme ssd in one of these pci express cards just like this but you wont get the full benefit unless its a newer one because you wont actually be able to boot from the drive and right now nvme drives are a little bit too expensive for most people to want to use them as a steam library and various yet another wrench to throw in the spokes of this whole ordeal while the connector on the motherboard may be capable of both n be and ahci operation im not aware of any nvme mdot two drives that will work across either protocol so if you have an nvme board you want to get an mdd drive or maybe you could run an hdi one and if you have an ahd i only mdot two slots then you will need an ahci so more protocol overhead ssd just like this one and dont expect to get earthshattering performance out of it we are working with rock cat look at that its like its spin move or whatever the giveaway will run for seven days from today seven days so move fast so i hope that clears things up and you guys have a better understanding of mdot  now i sure do because i had to do all this research to make this video so thanks for watching guys that youre done doing all those things are probably wondering what to watch next so check out our latest video right there over on channel super fun i think its like rc car bowling or some nonsense like that pretty fun

__label__1 phone reviews have honestly become kind of routine for me first i switched to the device entirely then i use it as my daily driver for anywhere from two to six weeks maintaining a google doc where i dot down anything about it that pissed me off finally when its time to actually write the review i sit down with my list of annoyances cross off all the ones that were resolved either through software updates or experience and then create the script that i will eventually read to you like this well the galaxy note 9 is bunning up my formula here because this is all i got so lets see if we can pad that out into seven minutes or music i covered most of the surface level stuff about the note 9 in my unpacked video but now that ive spent some more time with it i have some thoughts to add economically the boxier shape of the note 9 compared to the s9 plus that ive been using as my daily driver has been an adjustment as has the additional weight but one of the most meaningful tweaks that samsung made to the form factor was widening the bezels this results in a slightly worse screen to bezel ratio which is a risky move at a time when competitors like oppo are going as far as to put in motorized camera mechanisms so they can keep pushing the envelope but from a usability standpoint its been a noticeable improvement especially when reaching across the screen the other economic stand out to me is the bixby button now i assumed that there would be first party support for disabling it again but for some reason samsung as of the time were recording this has removed that option overall though like i dont actually hate bixby she runs locally on the device which means that on top of the additional functionality that other assistants cant handle like executing voice macros she is noticeably faster for transactional things like turn on the flashlight but thats a doubleedged sword because compared to the google assistant which runs in the cloud bixby is still over a year later far less likely to understand me the fingerprint sensor has been moved into the center just like on the s9 series but i actually didnt notice it that much since i ended up using intelligent scan samsungs unique combination of iris scanning and facial recognition most of the time anyway so now were at the part of the video where usually i list out a bunch of specs but its a little bit complicated this time which processor you get under the hood of your note 9 will actually depend on your region now the good news is that it doesnt actually matter too much we only got one so we couldnt do a headtohead comparison but basically the snapdragon 845 adreno gpu is stronger for your gamer while samsungs internal tuning of the exynos 98 ten cpu seems to give it the edge on that side of things honestly though were kind of splitting hairs at this point and samsung knows it they hardly even talked about performance in their keynote because phones have basically succumbed to the same failing of moores law that weve been dealing with on the pc side for the last five years now so whether youre running a note 9 or a 1  6 for literally half the price you can expect basically the same performance in your pocket at least from idle now the water cooling marketing nonsense aside the big heat pipe that samsung is using in the note 9 does actually result in relatively little throttling even in cpu intensive tasks and that i think right there is the most remarkable thing about the note 9 not the heat pipe specifically but the fact that its bigger than yours and they managed to squeeze that the spen the four thousand milliamp hour battery thats big enough that even with the weird battery drain bug that i get sometimes i still managed to make it through the day they crammed basically everything into this phone other notable inclusions up to 8 gigs of lpddr4 memory thats in the 512 gig storage version ip68 water resistance nfc high speed wireless charging microsd expansion a headphone jack and stereo speakers samsung by the way with their spectacular hdr oled displays and flexible audio connectivity continues to deliver handsdown the best mobile movie watching experience so heres the thing almost always when im working on a phone review because i actually switched to them as my only phone i wish that i you know had the form factor of phone x with the features of phone y and the camera of film z or something along those lines most recently i was actually working on my full review of the oppo find x and i was crestfallen when i realized that it doesnt have nfc i mean thats apparently not a big deal in china but i use nfc for twofactor authentication on a very regular basis it was a real bummer for me and no9 the camera hasnt changed much since the s9 series but thats not really a terrible thing its low light performance is still outstanding and everything from welllit indoor stills to more challenging scenarios like poorly lit video came out as well as i would expect from any flagship smartphone today as for the new bluetooth enabled spen as a not really a stylist guy its mostly a handy little bonus and you know you can write on the screen even when its off i guess thats pretty cool but i mostly didnt find many occasions to use it even including the remote camera shutter functionality with that said i expect some really cool things to come out of the spen once the sdk lens until then assuming that you can afford one because its not cheap the note 9 is gonna have to settle for being just the zero compromises smart phone a designation that i have never given to any other handheld

__label__1 yeah i understand well the orders are in were back at hq and its time for us to review the most challenging portion of 1500 si pc secret shopper projects secret agent magnum i know this is how all of our competitors responded to a fairly rudimentary technical support request i know i just was setting up to the computer i bought for my brother and i noticed that in the system it says theres only 8 gigabytes of memory but in the order its supposed to be 16 so first its our favorite alien work thank you for calling alien where the quickest way to get you to the right support agent is to get your products express service code this is different from your service tag or asset id i dont know what my service card would be is this five minutes already ive just peered dicking about are we just sitting here in silence again hello is it me youre looking forward oh you know youre not doing on hold right when you have to come back and say hello are we 15 minutes into this call and they havent even gotten as far as who are you and what do you have are we being asked for the order number again okay man just take an agenda and transfer your call to technical department were known as a technical department yet thank you for calling your basic hardware warranty support yeah have your piston service tag or the express a with food you just ask for all our information again oh my god were explaining the problem again oh im extremely sorry to hear that should happen but you should not have happened yes okay thank you astounding observe a shooting transferred again we have had nearly half a dozen people that weve talked to and alienware in pre sales and after sales support just put us on hold for am i are you able to guide me through it i dont actually know that much about computers then and then she goes through youtube and shows us the video about how to access the memory okay all right well im okay with that on this video well teach you how to replace your brown modules on the aurora r5 nothing beats off billing plastic covers after you neal aurora again to alien wheres credit this system is pretty straightforward to get at sorry is this the right video are you looking for a different one do i need to unplug it first no its oh yeah there you go genesis first first ram swap everyone ladies and gentlemen so in summary do i understand this correctly it took just shy of a full hour with five separate departmental transfers to diagnose a ram stick that came loose during shipping hopefully the next one can do better here we go all right origen show me your leadership before bc i do need to verify the information i have once you kill did you provide me with the address so we have a problem okay so it took four minutes to get to the point where we verified the order and everything thats not terrible okay well yeah i definitely definitely see that the invoice says to 8gigabyte sticks of origin pc ddr4 three thousands of megahertz ram its possible that maybe one of the sticks got loose during transit possible given the vibrations that the machine co undergoes during transit you know very possible that one of the modules came slightly loose enough you know to not be recognized this would require you having to essentially open up your machine so that you can double check on this are you familiar with pc hardware to any extent like would you be able to identify memory modules on a motherboard probably not would you be able to help me out with that kind of problem absolutely you got the email with the link to the dropbox video thats kind of weird why wouldnt they just host it on youtube i gotta say alien wheres production values were a little nicer thats probably not the way that i would show most users how to do that ideally putting using both your thumbs to put equal force on each end of the stick and youll feel a very noticeable click his video 3 out of 10 his instructions solid 9 out of 10 i gotta say janice for someone who doesnt seem to have been doing this before you youve youve done this a lot faster than some of the most of the customers im on the phone with so haha smooth operator ah interesting so weve actually thrown an extra curve ball at origin pc here plugging the hdmi connector into the motherboard rather than our dedicated graphics card oh that big card has a ribbon cable that goes from the card itself to the motherboard and if that came loose slightly then youre probably not gonna get a picture this is a good explanation but hes got the wrong diagnosis lets see how long it takes him and to clarify when you initially got picture do you know whether or not you were coming out of the graphics card or the over the onboard video on a motherboard hes done this before 19 minutes including a detailed explanation and walkthrough of the petcock with plugging the monitor into the onboard io versus the gpu directly competent great job thank you for calling main gear manufacturer of a would winning pcs and workstation now this is the real test if they can manage to turn an order number into like really the order number would be five or six digit and start with an eight or nine okay at least thats clear instructions all right let me let me remotely connect to your p2p and i would look at a couple of things all right pops up device manager i dont know what hes expecting to find in device manager hes probably just kind of like oh i havent done this in a little bit hold on there it is slots used one of two immediately nails the diagnosis if you look inside your machine so ten minutes to diagnosis you should see a let me go look at your one as well if i could be more specific wow okay nice there should be four or it could be four or eight but usually its for vertical flight oops its two and it said that in task manager i guess they dont sell a lot of lowend stuff i would usually assume a main gear system probably has four or eight computer shut down the computer im gonna have you open up the machine and were gonna make sure those things are in there properly does he mentioned unplug it though okay so with the computer shut down i want you to unplug all the connections from the back all right rock on main gear guy looks like thats all it was just a loose ram stick but youre youre all set if um running any other issues feel free to give me a call back sure thank you so much thats it so excluding some random nonsense with our monitor not properly waking from an hdmi signal etc about 15 minutes start to finish dang one quarter of the time and so much less frustration like it was just friendly the voice on the other end of the line is crystal clear i mean you cant take that kind of thing for granted honestly like you could understand the guy for tech support press 3 straight to tech support like why doesnt del have that feature those thing that complicated if you feel comfortable looking inside of the pc remove the left side panel of the computer pull out the sticks of ram and simply repeat them to see if in case one of them is not data properly got the diagnosis is that excuse me mother did i even just hear you correctly the motherboard i advise you either you know from so many family member has a little more experience or have someone help you remove that stick around madrid not everybody has a family member that can help them thats why they bought a prebuilt ammar guy ok i dont really know who to ask so you youre not able to like tell me what im looking for six of em are on the motherboard itself music so is it those to vertical music hes a brand corner yes oh you promised that would be pullin odd and play it back in but again be careful with that because if youre on what youre doing you break something youre gonna put all your warranty on them thanks buddy so i just should find someone else to help me if you have a family member or friend whos tech savvy yes it is i by power employing her friend or family member to provide their tech support hes just waiting for her to hang out like hey yeah not a not a problem to not be very helpful with anything unreal in dells defense they got the problem solved an hours investment in getting your new computer setup or whatever is not the end of the world given youre gonna run it for eight or nine years but to just treat the customer like an idiot and outright refuse to help them okay and youre not able to help me through that not my ability to manage your ability to look inside experian im familiar with the part its gonna be very difficult to do anything inside of this requires its not my ability its your ability completely unacceptable im ready it cant be worse than a lien here oh so they dont even have an easy way to get in touch with them i actually dont even mind this form on one condition it gets best on when someone picks up the phone they have read and understood it hold on im transferring you to someone who can help you now do i have the pleasure of speaking with today hi my name is janice music and electing toll camp so he doesnt have the form what is the purpose of the farm holy sh hes asking for her phone number alright so what were gonna do is were gonna get a hold of the sales department why to get solutions for your hp product please hang up and go to wwf port hpcom where you can troubleshoot or get software and drivers when your phone support that you can only call by finding the number by navigating the  website tells you to go to the website your done goofed sorry i still didnt get that just tell me what kind of product youre calling about desktop pc okay we make many types of desktop pcs you might say something like pavillion spectre presario omni touchsmart or envy go ahead and tell me what kind you have omen have your product model and serial number ready for your agent hold on im transferring you now okay janice oh yeah it looks like they did ship go like the configuration that shipyard does actually you have to eat i dont see issuing 16 like the one they ordered we personally removed half the memory so unfortunately all i do tech support im unable to access like a the sales offer two look it up but i cant provide you the number if youd like so heres the issue right now every company we talked to where the rep had an ounce of experience with pc hardware immediately identified the problem im not imagining that this is common okay i know that we were trying to get you over to like the canada sales department today send you back over to us yes okay what did they end up saying exactly well they did confirm that like the order was for 16 gigabytes and then i got transferred a bunch of times and i ended up here somehow interesting let me let me see here applause you should have 16 gigabyte right yeah thats what i thought as well probably theres the theres a setting that you need to check or verify that maam if its acuity i can connect you to darwin technical support what setting makes ram up here oh cut the download url is he actually gonna start trying to troubleshoot for us now is this is this the magic moment 20 minutes in or whatever let me put you on a brief hold what i do a little bit more research here it shouldnt be any more about probably five to seven minutes or something well be right back with you okay dennis thank you for that okay how long were we on hold for ten minutes music 14 twice as long the amount of time we spend on hold without nothing happening is the amount of time it took like mania in order to resolve the whole problem and the amount of time that dell spent in complete and utter silence i dont know why they ended up actually transferring you back over to us that should have been handled on their set of things in order to get that fixed because you just stopped the computer is well before the 30 day mark and everything like that they should have been able to get that going to rectify the issue for you you had mentioned like looking in the case and checking or like seeing if i had the two sticks which i havent done i dont know much about computers so i didnt dare do that should i should i do that first again janus helping out tech support here what can happen while computers are being shipped and everything they do get to moved around and everything so it could end up being that it just needs to be unplugged and plug right back in on both of them because we dont know which one could be unseated and then it might actually fix your issue right there as being able to detect that it has 16 gigabytes after that okay he knows so heres my issue with this guy because he has mostly come across as though he pretty much knows what hes talking about the issue though is seems to be a policy one if i had to guess within 30 days its sales problem after 30 days tech supports problem he just was trying really hard not to have to do troubleshooting instead opting to send free product or push us back to sales like its not like they werent willing to solve the problem they just didnt want to diagnose it isnt that weird like 8 gigs of ram thats not insignificant thats like 80 bucks they were just gonna send it hp managed to be worse 72 minutes to get a stick of ram unseated and reseeded and hp had the advantage of janice already actually knowing how to pull out and replace memory by this point are you ready to declare a tie origin and main gear with shockingly dell with that performance taking the bronze medal here followed by hp who ultimately did at least solve the problem with ibuypower in dead friggin lasts theyre not even the best theyre like well they just didnt finish stay tuned for the next part where ivan will be performing autopsies on all the systems looking in depth at how the preloaded software came and all that kind of good stuff in the meantime though

__label__1 microsofts been trying their darndest to make their edge browser happen an uphill battle given internet explorers reputation among consumers and i would say bet alongside the strategicallyplaced and im going to say this snarky prompts that windows 10 is always dishing out for you to make edge your default browser the juiciest peach that microsoft has to entice users to jump ship is their claim that edge offers better battery life than any other browser but does it in this episode of manufacturers say we explore the current state of browser battery life and determine if microsofts claims constitute an epic mic drop or an epic ball drop for our tests we used four brandnew identical inspiring 1575 59 s loaned to us by dell thanks dell so from the moment these landed in our office careful attention was paid to keep them as similar to one another as possible if steam was installed in one machine it had to be installed on the other three as well so one thing we needed to know was with manufacturing tolerances in mind just how identical are these machines if we had a lemon we needed to know about it so we ran pc markets home conventional battery test on each laptop twice and although there is some variability in the test results we consider all of them to be within the margin of error that weve come to expect from pc mark and no machine was consistently better or worse than any of the others across the two tests next we had to control our testing conditions if one of the machines decides to update its bloatware value added preinstalled software thanks dell halfway through an overnight run thats just too much pee in the punchbowl for that machines results to be meaningful so we uninstalled everything with dell in the name iced mcafee blacked out geforce experience locked down windows privacy and politely asked cortana to reenact her death scene at the end of halo 4 then having run out of puns we disabled telemetry set the brightness to 50 and set the system volume to 15 with our machines sufficiently sanitized we were ready to move on from synthetic tests to reallife loads starting with edge running on all four machines once again to sure consistency so we designed our realworld tests to reflect actual internet browsing some social a  of news a sprinkle of autosave and a 6hour stream of the fork a yule log pretty typical stuff for this time of year and wait what on the very first test we had machines dying up to an hour and a half earlier than the others even though theyre all the same laptop running in identical environments with the same browser so we did the same test two more times and got similar results what gives in order to find out if the inconsistencies were due to the browser or due to the machines we would end up needing a lot more tests so we downloaded chrome firefox and opera on each machine and ran tests after tests rotating the browsers across the machines and as for the results well there do seem to be some differences between units 1 2 4 with machine 3 toeing the border of dud territory but thats far from the whole story when we ran chrome or opera on all four machines they died within 20 minutes of each other and if we compare the best and worst times of individual browsers across multiple tests on the same machine we see that edge just has the biggest range between its lap times but hold on linus microsoft never claimed to have the most consistent battery life they claimed to have the best battery life its a tortoise and a hare thing well no you hold on because were just getting started not only did edge not trounce the competition in our tests it didnt even get the high score chrome did well hold on again linus because edge just got a huge battery life boost with the recent windows creators update and you i didnt even use the same testing methodology that microsoft did when they made these claims to begin with you know what you hold on even harder because this project took freaking forever and we actually did tests before and after the creators update and although idi performed very well and not to mention much more consistently after the update it still didnt break our longest life record and besides since microsofts testing methodology is public well rick recreated that one too and eds still got beat who got to calm down here its conclusion time so prior to the creators update edge had big winners and big losers but since then its closer to the consistently good performance that we observed from chrome opera is also a good choice and it even has a battery saver mode but well didnt improve our life in our tests but did improve consistency and as for firefox well its probably not your best bet if battery life is your number one priority so bottom line at the time of writing edge no longer has well an edge when it comes to battery life but microsoft certainly deserves props for stimulating healthy competition that benefits us all except that is safari people

__label__1 using technology to learn about your health is pretty cool but not everyone wants a smartwatch or even a fitness band well fortunately its 2018 so someone figured out how to wrap that technology around your finger im mr mobile and this is the motive ring when i first handled this ring at ces it was so small in light that i thought it was a show floor dummy its hard to believe theres any technology in here let alone a battery big enough to power it most of that is invisible the accelerometer is internal and the optical heart rate sensor faces your finger when being worn so the only evidence this is more than a regular ring is the single led which is usually off the whole package is encased in a titanium outer shell rated waterproof to 5 atmospheres if id to find one complaint about the hardware its that i guess its a little wide otherwise its as refined as it gets to put that hardware to use you need to fire up the motive app instead of just counting your steps the app blends that data with the continuous heart rate tracking to get a sense of how many active minutes youre logged during the day the american heart association recommends about 30 active minutes a day 5 days out of the week so the app periodically gives you cards letting you know how close you are to hitting that goal or if it needs you to confirm that its some activity attract was correct itll throw up a card for that to see the brain syncs with your phone automatically via bluetooth and if you want you can force a sync by spinning it around on your finger three times which is kind of fun also because the ring is so small and light its a pretty great sleep tracker i wore it alongside of fitbit ionic for my three day review period and each morning i enjoyed checking each one to see how well id slept quantified by my resting heart rate and how much id moved during the night two out of two trackers agree i need more sleep since i brought up the competition motive does lag behind in features fitbit offers more data about your health at almost every level its backed up by a huge community of users and it lets you track your stats in real time as wearables review of the motive ring points out the picture the ring paints of your health is more a retrospective one also that manual sync doesnt always work and for now the motive app is only available on ios the android app is expected in the second quarter of 2018 again there arent many hardware downsides but the ring is reportedly prone to scratches on the finish and it doesnt last as long as many fitness bands motive quotes three days per charge which my unit fell just two hours shy of i do have to say this pretty impressive considering how tiny this battery is recharged takes 80 minutes using a clever and small usb charger its tough to see any shortcomings on a device that costs 200 bucks but motive does have some overhead here i mean every buyer first gets a sizing kit in the mail to match ring to finger and each ring also comes with two chargers one for home and one for your keychain more to the point the motive ring packs the same technology as some fitness bands in a much smaller prettier package if you wear a band or a smartwatch already youll probably find this redundant but if you dont wear one of those maybe because theyre too bulky or flashy well the motive ring is the fitness tracker youve been waiting for and maybe just a glimpse into a future of many more connected wearable devices

__label__1 jets for low pay and get more pilots flying the larger planes earlier that leaves the brunt of the impact of this
__label__1 if youve ever looked at a flight tracker sometime around 1000 or 1100 pm eastern you might have noticed something perfect lines of planes stretching all the way to europe these are just some of the over 2000 daily flights that cross the northern atlantic with so many flights there just has to be organization this is the most direct route from new york to london you may think its this a straight line but that straight line isnt actually a straight line this curved line is a straight line because despite what some may think the earth is curved from new york to london the curve you see on a flat map isnt too extreme but in the case of a longer flight such as from new york to bangkok the most direct route is not this but this straight over the north pole it makes a lot more sense if you look at a north pole oriented map if you draw the most direct route between atlanta and london youll see that it passes over every major east coast international airport that means that planes from atlanta to europe travel on the exact same route as planes from charlotte washington baltimore philadelphia new york and boston all these transatlantic planes typically leave between 6  8 pm eastern to time their arrival for early morning in europe that means that there are potentially hundreds of planes all going the exact same route at the exact same time the north atlantic also has something known as the jet stream these easterly winds average around 110 miles per hour and if planes fly in them they can cut hours off their travel time however the winds are only strongest in a line three miles high and 100 miles wide that further concentrates the flights on average an eastbound transatlantic flight from new york to london takes about six hours and 15 minutes coming back against the jet stream the same flight takes over seven hours sometimes the winds can be even more active such as on january 8th 2015 when british airways flight 114 flew from new york to london in only five hours and 16 minutes a new record for a commercial subsonic plane on that day the jet stream was blowing over 200 miles per hour and the boeing triple7 reached a speed of 745 miles per hour only 16 miles per hour below the sound barrier so when winds can cut an hour off a flight and a triple seven burns 2700 gallons of fuel per hour and jet fuel costs a dollar in 89 cents per gallon thats a 5103 dollar difference between being in the right and the wrong wins hopefully you now see why this is important so there are all these planes that are flying the exact same route but usually thats no problem the busiest route in north america new york to chicago sees over 100 flights per day leaving as frequently as every five minutes during the morning and evening rush and these planes just fly the most efficient route before the flight route planners file a plan with air traffic control and during the flight theyre just directed by air traffic control in a way that keeps some five nautical miles from other planes the difference between new york to chicago and new york to london is that over the north atlantic there is no radar you see radar only extends about 250 miles offshore transatlantic planes can be more than a thousand miles from shore thats why every morning the route planner is at gander air traffic control center in gander newfoundland published todays north atlantic tracks the night before every airline that will fly across the atlantic the following day sends gander a preferred route message indicating what they think the best route will be for the most part gander center follows these requests and creates a set of ten or so routes these tracks attempt to get the most amount of planes on the most efficient route to europe the tracks are labeled zulu being the southernmost route yankee being the second southernmost then xray than whiskey and so on and so forth heres how a flight on the tracks works and ill warn you this is when the video gets technical lets say were going from new york to paris around half an hour before scheduled departure the captain talks to normal air traffic control to request clearance for the route up to around newfoundland canada in most cases clearance is given and soon after will take off about when the plane crosses the gulf of st lawrence the pilot will request the north atlantic track that he or she desires heres todays message describing the days routes over the atlantic after looking over this the pilot decides to request track whiskey that means that at least for now well head towards the raffin waypoint our oceanic entry point waypoints are fixed spots that are used for flight navigation these are much easier for air traffic control to communicate to pilots than map coordinates when speaking over radio occasionally youll see some creatively named waypoints just north of lebanon new hampshire theres ham burger and fries on approach to kansas city airport theres spicy barbeque turkey smoked ribs boston has two waypoints in support of their sports teams but cubs and bears some waypoint names are more somber on the northern approach route to washington reagan national airport just miles away from where a plane hit the pentagon on 911 the waypoints read we will never forget september 11th since the north atlantic tracks change every day the modem just gives the entry and exit way points and then coordinates for the rabbin between since the track coordinates are preprogrammed into the autopilot before takeoff theres no reason to name them as waypoints since they wont be given over radio in the case of this flight were requesting track whiskey and more than likely gander control center will give us permission although sometimes theyll tell us to take a different track usually because were closer to another plane than the minimum separation distance since its much more difficult to know where planes are over the north atlantic theyre required to be 15 minutes separated about 140 miles rather than the normal 5 miles in areas with radar coverage assuming were granted clearance well head towards the raf and waypoint and make sure that our satellite communication systems are working then well check to see if our highfrequency radio is working a backup in case other communications go down minutes later just after passing raf and waypoint the controller will say radar services terminated have a good night and were on our own all the north atlantic tracks are preloaded onto autopilot so theres really nothing to do except wait when we hit 30 degrees west will enter the shanwick airspace approaching western europe we switch our radios to shanwick frequency and fly a few more hours to our oceanic exit point guns away point meaning weve successfully traversed the northern atlantic

__label__1 in 2015 a bombshell report came out detailing how the tsa the agency responsible for airport security in the us missed 95 of drugs explosives weapons and other prohibited items sent through their scanners in a test in 2016 the same test was repeated with the same result the following year 2017 the test was repeated again with an improved success rate but still it lets 70 of prohibited items through in fact within the us theres no evidence that the tsa has ever prevented a terrorist attack and outside the us there are very few examples of physical airport security thwarting an attack airport security slows people down increases cost and yet does little to actually improve safety so its safe to say that airport security is broken but why since the purpose of aviation is to get from one place to another its tougher a single country to regulate the industry instead the international civil aviation organization a united nations agency does all but two un member countries lichtenstein and dominica are part of the icao so its regulations are more or less universal theyre the ones responsible for making sure that air transport works the same way all around the world but what they require for airport security is rather in concrete they simply say measures need to be established to prevent weapons explosives and any other dangerous devices articles or substances which may be used to commit an act of unlawful interference the carriage and bearing of which is not authorized from being introduced by any means whatsoever on board an aircraft engaged in civil aviation essentially all they require is that before a passenger gets on board a plane the airport assures they dont have weapons while the icao does determine whether this requirement has been fulfilled its up to each country to decide how they achieve that in the us airport security works like this after checkin a passenger goes to have their documents checked puts their backs through an xray scanner and walks through either a metal detector or millimeterwave scanner there are potentially additional steps such as a patdown or explosives residue tests for some but these three steps are how the process works for most it is though important to note that if you so choose you can skip the metal detector or millimeter wave scanner step of the process and receive a patdown instead this is fully compliant with icao regulations since it does effectively screen an individual for weapons in fact an airport could hypothetically be compliant with icao regulations only by conducting physical bag searches and patdown since this does screen for weapons even if this would be slow invasive and unpopular some small airports actually do this for backs they physically search them instead of passing them through an xray the words security theater are thrown around a lot in regards to us airport security this term is used pejoratively it means that the tsa function is to make airports look secure but heres the thing on paper the tsa has done its job there has not been a single death on a flight leaving from a us airport since 911 as a result of terrorism in fact in the same time period there has not even been a single attempted terrorist attack on a flight leaving from a us airport all have been on flights originating from abroad so maybe the tsa is doing its function maybe the mere threat of being caught has been enough to thwart terrorists or maybe terrorists have moved on from attacking airplanes the us is certainly a prime target for terrorism but there are more controversial nations israeli airport security is considered to be the best in the world despite being situated in one of the most politically contentious countries in the world no airplane leaving from tel avivs bengurion airport has ever been hijacked or bombed its been attempted but this airport security is simply nearly impenetrable whats most fascinating is that this airport is hardly using any super advanced technology they use exact same metal detectors as the us and europe but they focused on the human factor israel has come to realize but its unfortunately easy to get weapons through airport security plastic explosives nonmetallic knives and blunt weapons are just tough to detect so rather than focusing on the weapons that could be used for an attack they focus on the people who could use them at bengurion airport security starts before passengers even get to the airport cars passed through a security checkpoint a mile away from the airport entrance where guards inspect cars and look for any suspiciouslooking individuals the minute passengers arrive at the airport theyre being watched already highly trained plainclothes officers roam around in the checkin area again searching for individuals acting abnormally or nervous then before passengers are even allowed to checkin theres the interview anyone whos passed through ben gurion airport knows how intense this interview is but its likely the single greatest factor leading to the safety of israeli airports passengers are first asked standard questions like what their jobs are why they came to israel how long they stayed for and if they pack their own bags and all the while the security agent watches the passengers face for reactions theyll also probe deeper asking why the passenger has been to various countries stamped in their passport theyll then ask oddly specific questions which school they went to when they last moved what kind of car they have these are all to see if the passenger is being honest about who they are if a security officer senses hesitation or finds a hole in their story they could deem the passenger a higher risk when passengers have completed their interview a barcode is placed on the back of their passport that starts with a number from 1 to 6 if it starts with 1 the passenger is deemed a very low risk this is almost only given to israeli citizens while if it starts with 6 the passenger is deemed a very high risk and will be subjected to extremely thorough screening while a lot of the risk determination has to do with the interview profiling also plays into it according to the israeli security system passengers are deemed higher risk if they are male if they are traveling alone if they are young and most of all if there are arab israel unapologetically uses racial profile in their risk assessment which has led to international condemnation israel meanwhile argues that this technique is effective after all the country has recently been at war with many of its arabian neighbors at the same time though its almost impossible for an arab traveler to pass through bengurion airports without getting deemed a number six security risk western nonisraeli individuals are also generally considered to be a higher security risk typically receiving a four or five after the interview passengers are finally allowed to check in their check bags are put through a standard xray and then are placed in a pressure chamber the chambers pressure is lowered to the level of pressurised aircraft about the equivalent of six to eight thousand feet of altitude to set off any explosives designed to trigger when a planes cabin pressure is lower at cruising altitude meanwhile the passenger passes through a standard xray or body scanner this physical screening process is exactly the same as it would be in north america europe or asia they just walk through the scanners and grab their bags those deemed a higher security risk above three or four likely would have their bags manually searched and then the highest risk individuals five or six s are often taken aside for another round of questioning and a patdown the security doesnt even stop when passengers board the plane like the us israel has a system of air marshals armed security guards on planes but unlike the us at least in the case of al al israels national airline there are air marshals on every single flight they said among the passengers often near any that were identified at the airport as highrisk and they have alert buttons that communicate with the pilots in case of an attempted hijacking if the marshals press this button an alarm will go off in the cockpit and the pilots will often send the plane into a dive to knock the hijacker off their feet this technique has successfully prevented terror attacks in the past these air marshals secure the plane from the inside but in another system protects the outside allows planes are installed with thermal flares that deploy when a radar detects an incoming missile thermal guided missiles will then target the flares instead of the plane ll and the other israeli airlines also stay secure by having security officers at their destination airports for departing passengers to israel they repeat much of the same security process as at bengurion airport conducting interviews profiling and assessing the risk of each passenger at many foreign airports these agents also physically screen luggage before handing it off to regular airport security ll despite being the flag carrier of one of the most controversial nations in the world at its last and only hijacking in 1968 and even this incident resulted in zero deaths it and bengurion airport are testaments to the fact that truly secure security is theoretically possible but is it possible worldwide heres the thing about tel avivs airport its not that big twenty million passengers pass through it each year making it only as busy as san diego or berlin airport these are not small airports but theyre not on the same scale as the worlds largest like jfk heathrow or dubai its tough to determine if a system like what israel has implemented could scale up to be used universally what sure is that certain elements of the israeli system would not work most countries could not justify a system that relies so heavily on racial profiling in many countries and us states practices such as this are simply illegal but still airports and countries around the world are watching israeli security methods closely the us has already implemented a system of security interviews for many international flights to the us however these are generally conducted by less trained contract workers brussels airport after its terrorist bombing in 2016 now positions officers trained in behavioural detection at its entrances plenty of other airports have sent delegates to bengurion airport to evaluate their security techniques as well and have quietly made changes to closer emulate israel but few ever stopped a question if we even want an increase in airport security if it comes at the expense of time maybe we dont as mentioned the us has not had a successful terror attack on an airplane since 911 worldwide airplane hijackings are now almost nonexistent but security has a consequence in the most direct way tickets for every single flight leaving from a us airport include a 5 and 60 cent fee that goes towards paying for security this may not be much in the scope of a multihundred dollar flight to europe or asia but if the us ever wants to get to the point where europe is of having 10 or 20 dollar budget airline tickets between domestic destinations this fee has to go a study found that the tsa s average cost per life saved how much money is spent to stop one human death is 667 million dollars you can certainly say that you cant put a price on a human life but the security that saves these lives costs lives the plane is empirically the safest way to travel its hundreds or thousands of times safer than driving so stopping people from flying is in and of itself deadly economists found that the increase in airport security in the us post 911 can account for six percent of the decline in air travel given that in 2002 more than 500 people died because as a result of longer security times and more extensive searches they chose to drive over fly and were involved in a fatal accident flying being easy helps everyone it lets people travel faster and it helps airlines as businesses just as long as it doesnt result in a decrease in safety in israel passengers arrive three hours before their flights just to clear security which means plane travel is inefficient well in some places in europe airports encourage travelers to arrive a mere hour before their flight the goal is to keep security fast efficient but also secure no country or airport has the perfect system but to achieve this one likely needs to combine elements of the strictest security systems with those of the fastest israel can get away with invasive unethical yet effective security measures because they need to they are a country seemingly constantly at war many other areas of the world just arent big targets for terrorists its hard to know whether or not security measures are effective theres no control group of developed countries that dont have airport security to compare to the most effective security systems stop attacks by the mere threat of consequences rather than through physical screening so maybe airport security works in the us and europe and asia and all the other developed safe areas of the world one must therefore ask whether airport security is actually saving lives or ending them

__label__1 this video was made possible by squarespace build your beautiful website for 10 off at squarespacecom slash wendover according to conventional economic rules casinos shouldnt be able to exist thats because conventional economic rules assume humans are rational conventional economic rules would predict that if someone offered you a deal where you gave them 100 and they gave you 94 dollars and 80 cents back you wouldnt take that deal but for some strange reason perfectly intelligent people head to the roulette table every day and in essence take that exact deal just look an american roulette table has 38 numbers on it double 0 0  1 through 36 the best odds on the table are in the red black even and odd boxes if you put a 5 chip in the red box for example and the ball falls on a red number you double your money you gain 5 dollars but of course the ball can fall on 0 or double 0 which are neither red nor black and for these purposes neither even nor odd now if the zero and double zero didnt exist then playing roulette would make perfect sense if you came in with 100 and played infinite times you would leave with 100 because it would be a 50 chance of doubling your money each time in reality because of those zeros the odds of doubling your money are actually 474 that means that for every dollar you play you can expect to lose 52 cents but for some reason people still do it while this small gap in between fair odds and the odds casinos and other gambling institutions offer earn them worldwide close to half a trillion dollars per year but consider this for the same reason gambling shouldnt work insurance also shouldnt insurance is essentially the exact opposite of gambling insurance companies are basically gambling companies but the roles are flipped the insurance companies are the gamblers and youre the casino if you pay a car insurance company for example 1500 a year to ensure your vehicle theyre gambling that youre not going to cause more than 1500 in coverable damage in any one year but of course it takes money to run the insurance company so they need a margin metlife one of the worlds largest insurance companies for example takes in thirty seven point two billion from the people who hold insurance policies with them but then pay back in insurance claims just thirty 635 billion of course there are other sources of revenue and other expenses at metlife but just looking at the balance between what comes in and what goes out for insurance the odds are pretty decent compared to the roulette wheel for every dollar you give them you can expect to get about ninety seven point seven cents back but thats still losing money according to the same conventional economic rules that say that casinos shouldnt be able to exist insurance companies to just shouldnt work as a concept because people get back less and they put in but heres why they do just consider this would you rather with 100 certainty receive five dollars or would you rather have an eighty percent chance of receiving six dollars and twenty five cents feel free to think about it for a second but chances are that you said that youd rather have that sure five dollars when surveyed with this question over threequarters of respondents said that they wanted the certain five dollars over the 80 chance of six dollars and twenty five cents but heres the strange thing these two options are worth the exact same amounts if you took the eighty percent gamble infinite times you would receive an average of five dollars each time as 80 percent of 625 is five therefore in theory people should have no preference between these two options because theyre worth the exact same amount but heres the thing people in general dislike losing a given amount of money more than they like winning it that is the negative effect of losing five dollars for example is greater than the positive effect of winning five dollars because the second option comes with the chance of loss which is a negative experience more powerful than the positive experience of certainly gaining five dollars this option is worth less overall even if its worth the same in a dollar amount this is why insurance works insurance is a worthwhile gamble for the insurance company since the odds are in their favor and they make money while the gamble is worth it for you because the monetary amount you get back plus the absence of monetary loss make the deal worth more than the money you put in overall of course it is a bit more complicated than this since insurance companies often have preferential rates for health care and it helps smooth out economic shocks so despite being a gamble it is absolutely worth it in most cases but insurance at its most basic level is losing to avoid loss the principle of hating losing can be used to make the same amount of money worth more in one experiment 150 teachers in chicago heights were split up into three groups one group received nothing one was told that they would receive a bonus at the end of the year corresponding to how well the students test scores were and the third group was given the exact same deal for a bonus with the only difference being that they were given the bonus payment upfront at the beginning of the year and told that they would have to pay back the corresponding amount if their students did not score the test scores necessary the group that was promised the bonus if test scores improved performed largely the same as the group offered no bonus but the group given the bonus up front overall performed much better with test scores improving up to three times as much as the traditional bonus group its clear that the fear of loss is far more powerful than the promise of gain so this explains why insurance works but for the same reason gambling still shouldnt work but something interesting starts changing when you change the odds now remember that threequarters of people preferred a sure five dollars to an 80 chance of 625 but now think whether you prefer on a hundred percent chance of receiving five dollars or a 25 percent chance of winning twenty dollars once again the options are worth the exact same amount since twenty five percent of twenty is five dollars but with this change of odds those surveyed on average had no preference between the two options half preferred the sure five dollars and the other half preferred a 25 chance of twenty dollars the lets changed the odds again would you prefer on a hundred percent chance of receiving five dollars or a point five percent chance of winning one thousand dollars still with these numbers 05 of 1000 is five dollars so the two options are worth the exact same amount but with these options for the first time people prefer the gamble only 36 percent of respondents said that they would take the five dollars while 64 percent preferred the half percent chance of winning 1000 will we begun to understand is that humans like low probability risk we like a small chance of winning big over a certain game in fact you can see this at the racetrack the best horse might have twotoone odds where you get three dollars if they win for each dollar you bet while the horse might have 200 to 1 odds where you get 300 if they win for each dollar you bet but as it turns out on average the chance of the top horse winning is actually better than 2 to 1 and the chance of the bottom horse winning is the worse than 200 to 1 because people prefer betting on the underdog which inflates the odds you could therefore make more money betting on the horse thats likeliest to win crunching the betting data from 8000 tennis matches it was found that the bets on the best athletes with the best odds actually made money on average with 103 percent of the money won back while the bets on the worst athletes with the worst odds won just 81 percent of the money back evidence for this phenomenon has been found time and time again but the question of why we do it is tougher the simple answer for why this is is that people overweight the impact and chances of extremely low probability events this has been used to explain why people are so afraid of terrorism and plane crashes despite the chances of dying of either being monumentally small it really doesnt matter if you know that the odds are not in your favor like with the lottery or in the casino people still love risk if it comes with large returns and this is why gambling works as a concept everyone just has some arbitrary points were given two options with the same value theyll start accepting the risk over the sure money what that means is that in a gambling transaction with someone who bets and someone who accepts the bet both parties actually find what theyre doing worth while the casino finds what theyre doing worthwhile because they make money well the better finds what theyre doing worthwhile because they have the possibility of winning lots of money now the explanation for why people prefer these low probability bets moves further away from economics into psychology but one explanation with the lottery for example is that a bet doubling ones money does a little to change ones quality of life but a bet multiplying a persons money by a factor of thousands can be truly lifechanging so people are betting for monumental change rather than for another cup of coffee to summarize what this all means is that a 5 percent chance of 100 dollars is worth more to people than 5 dollars despite both having a monetary value of 5 dollars therefore by offering gambles people can make money more powerful almost everywhere in the world theres an issue of low savings rates people dont put an money into banks about half of americans could not immediately come up with 2000 if an unexpected expense came up according to one survey a big reason for this lack of savings is that banks are not incentivizing enough with how tiny savings accounts interest rates are many people just dont see a reason to put their money in banks and banks are unwilling or financially cant increase their interest rates so how do you make the same amount of money go further you turn it into a gamble economists created a concept for whats called a prize linked savings account a normal savings account with 2000 in it at a bank that offered 1 annual interest would earn 2000 a year but with a prize linked savings account instead of being given the 20 in interest it would be entered into a gamble with for example 04 percent chance of winning 5000 as always that gamble is still worth 20 monetarily but to the gambler its worth more these prize linked savings accounts have been incredibly successful at getting people to save in michigans trial of the system 56 of those using it were first time savers these same principles are the ones that make lotteries work in fact lotteries are just such easy ways of making money that in many countries privately run lotteries are illegal in the us for example all lotteries have to be staterun and their profits usually go to funding education because the states are guaranteed to make money from the lottery it is essentially a form of taxation in fact all forms of gambling are set up in a way that theyre guaranteed to make money for whoevers running them in a casino at a racetrack or with any form of gambling its never a good deal for the better but the reason why people engage in these deals is a fascinating study of behavioral economics and its principles if applied correctly can sometimes just maybe be used for good

__label__1 real life history is sadly missing out on some of the cooler parts of a game of thrones there once upon a time was a belief in giants dragons and magic but tragically none of that has been proven by modern science thankfully in real life in history weve never had to deal with frozen ice zombies before i dont really think that our medieval ancestors would have possibly been able to stop them without dragons or at least without jon snow being real but what real history has had to some extent is the rest of the story behind game of thrones in this video im going to be explaining some of the reallife bases and stories that inspired game of thrones that means that certain characters and locations from the books and show may have not only one historical inspiration but possibly several game of thrones is a unique story in a separate universe that doesnt perfectly reflect our own likewise our own history doesnt perfectly match up with game of thrones but it is incredibly interesting to see the similarities and the differences i will largely be focusing on medieval britain for this story so allow me to set up the story for you this is westeros on the left and the british isles on the right they dont really look too similar but with a little bit of tweaking on the right we can make them look very similar just move ireland over here under england flip it upside down and expand it to look like this you can definitely see the comparison now but now when we flip england sideways we get a pretty amazing contrast keeping in mind that in westeros across the narrow sea we have another continent called essos and in the real world we have another continent across the english channel called europe lets analyse how similar the history isnt britain to the history of westeros in around 1200 bce we have these guys called the celts who started to arrive in britain they had some spaceage technology that the small tribes of the islands didnt have called iron weapons like spears and swords the celts gradually settled all of the islands until this guy called julius caesar invades burton and 55 bce they left with some money but a guy named caligula decided he wanted to actually conquer the land so he assembled an army of 200000 romans to do exactly that in for tce but when they got to the beach in europe he got bored of that and ordered his soldiers to just collect seashells for him instead and thats not a joke by the way caligula really was that crazy anyway the romans actually invaded the land in 43 c and started to conquer the celtic tribes they expanded their border all the way up to here where they decided to build a wall that would stretch across the whole land mass from c to c the wall was built to keep the savage northern tribes like the picts and the caledonians out and ranking roman men who served at the wall were forbidden to marry and often served for their entire lives their men from all over the empire would come to the wall to defend the edge of the known world against the northern barbarians does any of this sound familiar yet in westeros we had the invasions of the first men who settled the land and they built a wall across the north to protect themselves from wildling barbarians and from frozen ice zombies the wall in westeros is 300 miles long 700 feet high and made of ice while the wall in burton is only 73 miles long varies between 10 and 20 feet high at places and is only made out of stone in westeros these new people called the andals invaded the land across the sea from essos and overthrew the first men kind of establishing a coexistence between the two the andals create dozens if not hundreds of tiny little kingdoms all across westeros that gradually over time formed into the seven kingdoms that we know of in the story in real world burton the roman empire collapsed in my fort nce the romans had abandoned the british isles after more than three centuries of rule in this atmosphere of chaos came a new invader however the germanic saxons and angles who crossed the sea from europe the saxons carved out a huge part of britain for themselves and they forced the celts out the celts and native britons were forced into areas away from the saxon conquest to places like ireland and scotland wales and cornwall and some even fled to brittany which is where brittany got its british sounding name from the area that the anglosaxons conquered like westeros was divided in a small petty kingdoms that eventually coalesced and wouldnt you know its seven kingdoms this is known in england as the hepped our key period the seven kingdoms inside england at the time were east anglia essex kent murcia northumbria sussex and wessex the seven kingdoms would eventually merge together to form the kingdom of england like how the seven kingdoms of westeros formed together to create the iron throne but were not there yet first we need our healthy dose of vikings to throw into the mix vikings started to make raids into britain starting in the year 789 theyre pretty similar to the ironborn inside westeros so lets stick to this analogy for now the vikings raid and pillage all across the british isles for centuries and even conquer the city of york which was the secondbiggest city in england at the im in 954 the last viking king of york who had the greatest name youve ever heard of eric bloodaxe was driven out of the city by the saxons the vikings continued to raid all around england and even briefly ruled the entire kingdom for about 20 years but the last raid finally came in 1066 this is a really interesting year because three men all decided to claim the english throne harold godwinson was the anglosaxon king being on that year but another herald named harold had radha thought that he should be the king to other harold was norse though and came with his scary viking army to enforce his claims on the throne homeboy was such a hardass his name had radha means hard ruler but god woodson wasnt no bitch and defeated him and crushed his army at the battle of stamford bridge now normally that would be enough to secure victory but at the same time william the bastard arrived from across the channel with his own army ready to conquer england william is most similar to aegon the conquerer from a song of ice and fire aegon sailed from across the narrow sea with his army and three dragons where he conquered all of the seven kingdoms of westeros well except for dorne but even doran gets secured by diplomacy later on aegon established the targaryen dynasty in westeros who ruled the throne all the way until roberts rebellion overthrew the last one the mad king aerys the second targaryen back in real life willing the bastard had no dragons but he certainly did have an army he landed in england and harold godwinson had just defeated the false king harada in the north probably after saying something like be fucking kidding godwin sen immediately turned his army around and marched 241 miles south to face william when he got there though williams shattered his army and its rumored that harold was killed by william himself and three other knights on the battlefield william the bastard was crowned king the same year became known as william the conqueror afterwards after aegon conquered westeros his descendants would rule for nearly three hundred years before being overthrown by robert baratheon the descendants of william in england have been shaky at times but they have mostly ruled the kingdom since 1066 elizabeth ii is technically the 22nd greatgranddaughter of william the conqueror himself and if the monarchy is an overthrown game of throne style by 2066 that will mark the 1000 year anniversary of the norman conquest and the near continuous reign of williams descendants to say that that entire family history has been full of drama would be a great understatement it was dominated by drama the biggest inspiration for the events behind game of thrones that we see during the war of five kings between joffrey stannis renly robb and balin was the war of the roses the war of the roses is a really really complicated power struggle that echoes much of the events that we see in a game of thrones and the war of the roses several men will claim to be king many at the same time and families will find each other almost a total annihilation there was a huge cast of extremely colorful characters who had multiple motives ambitions and unknown loyalties this video is already getting pretty long though unfortunately and the war of the roses will be a video on its own that will be even longer than this one now that the stage is set in the real world it must be filled with actors characters and most importantly a plot

__label__1 once again we are going to take a walk on the dark side of the human psyche so far weve covered perhaps the most wellknown serial killer in jack the ripper the most beastly in ted bundy and now we are about to enter the realm of perhaps the weirdest savage ever to hold a place in the serial killer hall of infamy he was the inspiration behind the hitchcock classic movie psycho as well as the texas chainsaw massacre and to some extent the silence of the lambs there hasnt really been anyone that shocked the world as much as this guy just ask the cops that discovered his house of horrors the ones that didnt succumb to a nervous breakdown anyway if you havent heard of him youre in for a surprise so welcome to this episode of the infographic show americas strangest serial killer ed gein first of all we should say that mr gein was not close to someone like ted bundy on the nasty scale nor was he as brutal as jack the ripper or as despicable as hh holmes if anything the man was warped beyond comprehension also known as the butcher of plainfield gain was no doubt mentally ill to an unfathomable degree so many of you will have heard of the movie psycho its rather old and most likely older than most of you watching you might have heard of the series the bates motel which is based on that movie well the main character in the movie was based on edie gain and indeed gain was said to have been brought up in an abusive family with a very oppressive and hyper religious mother he was born on august 27 1906 in a place called la crosse wisconsin according to serial killer websites gain had a beleaguered childhood having to listen to his mothers frantic preaching regarding sin and lust and the inevitable hell they would lead to it said his childhood was very isolated and he had few friends he had a brother who died in an accident when gain was still young some people have conjectured that gain killed him but theres no proof people have ventured that game being the shy and weaker brother killed his sibling and this could be compared to the old testament thriller cain and abel but stick with what we know one bio tells us at school he rarely socialized although we are told his teachers remembered that he had demonstrated queer mannerisms such as laughing randomly later in life his family moved to a farm and their game became even more isolated his mother may have been strict but its ed gein was obsessed with her he adored her she told him that having relationships with women was a sin and that all other women besides herself were prostitutes and dating them essentially meant being in league with satan himself this was not a good start for young edy especially if youve read freud on overbearing mothers gaines father died and so it was just him and the zealous mother but then she had a stroke and gain ended up having to look after her he took odd jobs around town and was known as a quiet decent guy who was reliable when you wanted something fixed apparently he was quite a capable handyman his devotion to his mother was unerring but it said that gain had become fascinated with stories about nazis and cannibals which he read in various books and death cult magazines his mother then passed away in 1945 leaving edy alone on the farm it said he kept the rooms where she had stayed in the same condition and locked them so they would stay that way forever he continued working his odd jobs and doing work on the farm but a few years after his mothers death king took up a new hobby to some extent that hobby was trying to become her now for the gruesome part as we said gain was not a prolific serial killer but what he did do makes up for the low body count in 1957 a woman that worked at a local hardware store went missing her name was bernice worden her son told police that one of the last people to be seen in the store with her was none other than the habitual hatwearing mr gein he was arrested shortly after and police received a warrant to check out the game farm this is not one of those serial killer stories with twists and turns because the cops found what they were looking for immediately upon searching the farm that was mrs wardens dead body shot with a 22 caliber rifle hung upside down in a shed like an animal the torso had been whats called in hunting dressed out meaning it was opened and the organs had been taken out the body was also mutilated from head to toe captain lloyds show poster who saw this grisly sight said tendons in the ankles had been cut and a rod had been placed through them the body was drawn up in the air by a block and tackle the body was dressed out and the head was missing her head was later found in a burlap sack ed had a thing for heads as you shall see this was obviously a sickening sight for the deputy that found the body but inside the house police got the shock of their lives as we said he liked to keep the heads of his victims police found five heads inside plastic bags as well as four skulls but more stomachchurning they also found masks whereby gein had carefully cut off the faces and kept them intact so he could wear them one police officer told the press some of them have lipstick on and looked perfectly natural if you knew them youd be able to recognize them in fact gein was a handyman in many ways and we are not talking about fixing creaking doors police found all sorts of things and not just human remains gained had made lampshades chair covers and waste baskets out of human skin he had human skulls sitting atop bed posts and in the kitchen you could find bowls made from skulls ala psycho he made a skin corset that he could get into and thereby be a woman or more specifically his mother he didnt leave out the bottom half having made leggings out of skin as well as skin socks perhaps his piece de resistance in terms of fashionable items was a belt made from womens nipples he also had a collection of noses and vulvas if ed wanted he could become a woman by wearing all of this but it wasnt all about dressing up he even had lips he could grab hold of on the end of curtain drawstrings according to one website gang would wear a death mask and the skin closed and then go and dance around in the garden with his costume on we cannot confirm this though it doesnt really matter because gain admitted he liked to wear the suit to become his mother so just the thought of him watching tv and his face mask and skin suit is horrifying enough now gain didnt kill people for all of his handiwork he told police that much of his raw material was gathered by robbing local graves he did ever admit to at least one more murder and he was suspected of having killed more women a famous quote of gain was this when i see a pretty girl walking down the street i think two things one part wants to be real nice and sweet and the other part wonders what her head would look like on a stick well some websites and even the movie american psycho attribute this to gain but other websites tell us it was another strange killer named edie kemper that said it such strangeness and brutality left its mark on plainfield which would never be plain again many people say the sheriff of the town died fairly young as a result of the trauma from investigating this case in fact one of the sheriffs friends said he was a victim of ed gein as surely as if he had butchered him gain was unsurprisingly found by the courts to be insane he was diagnosed with schizophrenia and a severe oedipus complex he died in 1984 from lung cancer in mendota mental health institute its thought he said this about his time in one mental institution i like this place everybody treats me nice some of them are a little crazy though he was buried in plainfield although it said parts of his grave are now missing because people wanted to take a souvenir home with them when they visited the question we will leave you with today is this are we correct in saying this is the worlds strangest serial killer let us know your thoughts in the comments this video was pretty terrifying

__label__1 why the heck do you guys need a whole roomful of servers just to make youtube videos we get asked this actually a lot of other questions about our data management and our workflow all the time so for the last year actually ever since we got our red cameras ive been meaning to do an update for you guys on how we handle such heavy footage how we share resources with such a large team and how we do all of that while maintaining our rigorous daily release schedule so when g winn reached out to us asking us to do a feature on their smooth for camera gimbal i thought well hey theres an opportunity why dont we grab this thing and take it with us while i show you guys the way that data flows through linus media group to become a video on your screen music so while i let you all appreciate the irony of a video about our overly complicated workflow shot on a cell phone with a simple handheld gimbal ill tell you guys a little bit more about the zoom four so its got a highly integrated control panel down here with apps for both ios and android that allow you to control your camera its got focus pull and zoom capabilities its got the ability to do vertigo shots with one button through the app or manually its got what they call phone go mode for instant scene transitions and its got both a quick standby mode and a oneclick mode switch everything that we shot outside of the intro and the souter right now was filmed on this its got a no date on it right now but it was shot on an iphone 10 and ill let you guys be the judge of the stabilized footage that comes off of it so to demonstrate some of the challenges with working with red footage were actually gonna take that intro that we just shot just now and were gonna ingest the whole thing to show you guys how we do it now red cameras are not great for recording audio in fact even with an external preamp it is really difficult to get anything resembling usable audio out of the camera directly so recently we finally gave in and resorted to an external audio recorder it really sucks to synchronize audio especially if youre stuck using the scratch audio that gets recorded directly to the camera and then the sd card out of your external recorder and aligning it manually but we recently got a little doodad called a tentacle sync you get two pieces here a master that sits on our mix presix and a slave that sits on our camera you synchronize them at the beginning of the day and what they do is they inject whats called time code into the mag and into the sd card so that you can easily synchronize them later on down the line but that is far from the only problem so the thing about the weapon 8k so thats our camera recently renamed the dsm see to helium or something like that is that it records footage theyre both the same camera at up to eight k 60 frames per second and with the 480 or 960 gig megs thats up to hundred megabytes per second so to put that in perspective if we were filming a simple tech linked episode even though we will usually use like a twenty to one compression ratio so thats about four times the compression that they would probably use on something like a feature film that means that a 10 gig clip could still end up being in the neighborhood of about  a 10 gig clip that means that a 10 minute clip could still end up being in the neighborhood of around 50 gigs and while its less of an issue for something like linus tech tips or tech quickie when youre recording dailies and youre expected to release the video on the same day that you film it like with something like a new show size of files ends up becoming a potential problem so thats why our to ingest stations which you might recognize from one of our tech showdown episodes are both equipped with 10 gigabit network cards so one of them has this asus one which is basically the last generation version of this action 1 theyre both using a quantities that allow them to be somehow under 100 for 10 gig networking there are a number of different ways that we ingest footage depending on the type of camera were using so for red you can see each of our video clips is actually a folder made up of smaller broken up video clips so were gonna go ahead and grab that and copy the whole thing into our project folder for this video so that goes in a roll one what were looking at right here is probably some kind of like weird buffering thing or something but this is about what wed expect to see in terms of our ingest speeds its not the full 10 gigabit because that would be in the neighborhood of one to one point one gigabytes per second but the reality of it is that youre going to run into bottlenecks elsewhere and in fact these red megs even though were using an esata interface for them are just not that fast and they only read it about 230 minutes a second then what we got to do is grab the audio clip off of our sd card that goes into our audio folder right here and thats pretty much the whole process for red footage but for that we wouldnt need powerful machines and there is a reason that each of these is running 64 gigs of ram and a 10 core extreme edition processor and thats because for our other cameras like the a7 s for example we actually use adobe prelude which is an imperfect piece of software but has its uses to transcode the footage when were bringing it in so what we do is we take whatever project it is and this is generally fast as possible we still shoot that on the a7 s we create a subfolder and we set it to transcode to cinna form 4k this improves our timeline performance when were scrubbing through the clips in adobe premiere the other thing that we do is set a second destination for the original files that were not transcoding just in case something goes wrong with the transcode which does happen from time to time and we need to go back and grab the original files now just to give you some idea even if were not using the full potential of this network connection all the time of what its capable of lets go ahead and just grab a file off the desktop and show you just what this puppy can do so that is saturating the read speeds of the raid 1 ssds that each of these machines are booted off of so that was a 10 gigabyte file lets go have a look on the other end of this ethernet cable at how exactly that whole thing comes together now ive shown you guys our server room fair number of times but i havent given you guys an update in quite a while on how exactly its working in here so the main server that everyone is editing off of at the same time is this one right here this is one xserve err and its running 24 plus 12 four or five six seven so its running 31 intel 750 series one point one terabyte nvme ssds and this guy is an absolute monster so if we fire up performance monitor you can see that even though weve got four of our editors in office right now and were seeing each of them doing a hundred and fifty one hundred and twenty fifty megabytes a second of reads this thing is barely suffering and our there we go our z disk you death is only about 05 thats the benefit of nvme is that nice fast responsiveness and in fact when we were still using our sata ssd server for every one we were starting to run into issues once we had the room fully staffed over there where adobe premiere would crash but not just trash everyones would crash at the same time and we narrowed that down to slow response times on our nas so this guys connected at 40 gigabits per second this one right here has 24 sata ssds and this one only gets used this is called qq server this one only gets used for large projects that only one person needs to work on at a time its still ssd based so we still dont run into any crashes or any other weird issues like that but it doesnt have quite the snap that an nvme machine does now something that we learned a really valuable lesson about i guess it must have been about two years ago was realtime data replication and offsite backup and that is where this guy comes in so i want to show you guys a little trick here i dont know if ive ever actually done this demo in a video before ive shown people that have come into our office so im going to use my test folder here and im going to create a document called test for video right here this is a text file on our main drive then im going to jump over to this hard drive based server under it so this is running 8 8 terabyte drives for a total of 64 terabytes and im just gonna pull up the wanek sink folder get that test folder open test iridium put back that hole just like that so within about five to ten seconds whether its a text file or whether its a large video file the synchronization software that were running here will automatically dump it over to here so if this crashes we can actually continue editing videos within about 10 to 15 minutes of switching over everyones map drives and another benefit that it gives us is that normally on a network drive when you delete a file its just gone but instead check this out if i delete test for video im actually going to have to do it from a separate server but if i delete test for video boop youre gone youre done and i go into here that file is going to disappear what what will happen is we can go into the deletions folder and we can rescue it this has actually saved our butts more times than i would like to admit because stuff does get accidentally deleted now all of this is only for active projects that we are working on right now once were done with something it goes on to petabyte project and were actually running both phases of it right now when we originally deployed it we were only using one of them so we could just save power on ours for all the drives that were in the other one not the case anymore so petabyte project is now up to seven hundred and seventyseven terabytes of total space of which weve consumed four hundred and thirtytwo this holds all of our archived projects so that in the event that we want to make a video that refers back to one of our other videos we can grab the original quality files rather than downloading off youtube like a lot of other youtubers do bring us into this room one of the biggest challenges is not just working with red footage because the files are so heavy one of the biggest problems that we have is that weve got multiple people working off of that same shared nas all at the same time so this is where the 10 gigabit connections that our editors are also using comes in were more scrubbing through footage we can actually see data rates in excess of twoandahalf gigabit per second so we peaked at just shy of four gigabit per second that my friends is why weve got the bangin mass with the highspeed networking so once the edits done taron or one of our other editors will export the entire project as an mov but those are extremely inefficient files so theyre theyre great quality but theyre absolutely massive so hes gonna copy that those in the transcode flow plane yeah and then you pasted here now whats gonna happen there is that watercooled server that i built a while ago the one thats at the very bottom of the rack is going to see that that file got transferred and then its going to spit out the correct formats for all the different platforms that we upload to whether it be youtube or flow plane or facebook or whatever the case may be that way the editors machine doesnt get tied up with this so this is cool once that file is done copying it does take a second and media encoder is not always perfect before itll pick it up but we use vnc in order to remote into that machine so everyone can go in at the same time unlike remote desktop connection and make sure that it has actually picked up the project and that its transcoding to the correct format okay cool the system works

__label__1 losing a pair of bluetooth headphones is nothing unusual especially if youre as scatterbrained as i am what is unusual is finding yourself back at the store a few days later buying the same headphones again because you just cant live without them im michael fisher and this is the quiet comfort 35 from bose the headsets so nice i bought it twice lets get something straight im not an audiophile okay i cant speak to bass response or treble values or things like that this is also my first ever wireless headset with active noise cancellation and im coming off a year using a pair of 60 headphones so what im saying is yeah take my conclusions with a grain of salt it would have been pretty hard for the qc 35 not to impress me that said i dare you to put these on and not fall at least a little bit in love the alcantara headband and synthetic leather ear cushions are super comfy and even powered off the cups offer a fair amount of passive muffling but when you flip the switch on the right side well you might want to sit down when the acoustic noisecanceling kicks in background noise instantly drops so low that its actually a little disorienting like you might literally want to be seated when you first power it up of course its not perfect if youre not playing any music youll still be able to make out nearby conversations and other transients but any constant sound like the thrum of an air handler or the roar of an engine is almost totally eliminated that makes the 35 perfect for planes buses and trains thats why if you pay attention youll probably see a lot of people in business class wearing them on your next flight its tough to illustrate the effect on video but lets give it a go the wall street journal measured this headsets average sound reduction at twenty point five decibels so heres a coffee shop recorded at normal volume and here it is at minus 20 decibels now that noise cancellation requires power but im understating it when i call the battery life here excellent i bought my first pair at san francisco international airport and flew six hours to boston streaming audio the whole way and i didnt even use up half a charge you get even more endurance if you use the bundled cable instead of bluetooth if the battery completely dies you can still use the cable to listen to music just without the noise cancellation oh and speaking of cables along with the 35 and micro usb for charge good guy bos also throws in an airplane adapter and you can carry all these together in the included travel case as for the sound itself my untrained ear makes it really simple to sum up its loud its warm and its beautiful and the computer voice that tells you what phones its connected to and how much battery you have left is a really nice touch to battery 100 connected to galaxy note 7 thats not to say these cans are all ace and no trouble for one thing i find the industrial design pretty dull the glass reinforced nylon is durable but not flashy in the least also the noise cancelling technology relies on microphones in the outer shell and those microphones are very sensitive to breeze so if its a windy day youre gonna hear an intermittent faint static on some gusts an annoying problem thats hard to overlook on headphones this expensive voice calls over bluetooth are fine but because bose pipes in some side tone to help you hear your own voice it can be disorienting to talk on these in a noisy environment and finally like most over ear headphones the 35 is uncomfortably hot in the summer it but then of course that means they should be mighty fine ear muffs come winter if youre an audio purist there are plenty of alternatives that might be better for you headsets designed for authentic sound above all else the thing is many of those sets are even more expensive than the 35 and as a non audiophile i have a hard time even spending this much but from what i can see and hear the qc 35 deserves all the praise its gotten and it earns its high price point im very happy to have it back and even if my second purchase wasnt a business expense id probably still have bought it again because like they say once you go bose its tough to go back to one of those wacka wacka

__label__1 im just going outside and maybe some time were the last words of british explorer lawrence oates as he walked out into a blizzard during an antarctica expedition he did this because he was sick and slowing the others down he made a sacrifice and was never seen again we can however infer that mr oates didnt survive very long and perhaps the remains of his body are still out there entombed in ice but there are some people who bid friends at you and just seem to disappear off the face of the planet this even happened to an entire plane full of people not too recently today well look at some of the most renowned vanishing cases in this episode of the infographic show disappearances that still cant be explained number 10 richey edwards well start with a rock star and know this list wont include elvis despite some people not believing he is 6 feet under richey edwards a member of the iconic rock group the manic street preachers did actually disappear and his body has never been found the enigmatic political poet became a member of the 27 club when its believed he may have committed suicide its not that simple though as edwards had given a book to a friend just before he went missing about a vanishing while missing he was also apparently seen that a passport office by a fan his car was later found abandoned close to a bridge known as a suicide spot he had always said he was too strong for suicide in spite of selfharming to add to the mystery people have said they have spotted him as far as goa india and also on some spanish islands to this day some people think hed had enough of fame and wanted complete anonymity rather than he threw himself off a bridge in wales number 9 benjamin bathurst and now for someone completely different a british diplomat called benjamin bathurst like the person at number 10 bathurst disappearance has also been the focus of widespread speculation on november 25th 1809 he was staying at an inn in germany while on government business he was getting ready and told his travel companion hed be down in a second and would join him in the horse and buggy he was never seen again search parties were sent to look for him even the hed only gone missing walking out of an into a parked carriage his story became a thing of science fiction with people writing about him entering a parallel universe or an inescapable maze in another dimension or that he was taken into the future others believed he was simply murdered by someone very skilled at hiding dead bodies number 8 jim thompson american jim thompson was known as the silk king and he made a fortune in the 50s and 60s when he almost singlehandedly reinvigorated the thai silk industry still today his stores bear his name in bold letters but at 61 years old in the year of 1967 jim went missing on a walk in the malaysian highlands and since then his vanishing has become the subject of many conspiracy theories there is even a book about his vanishing called jim thompson the unsolved mystery no one knows what happened although that didnt stop clairvoyance from chiming in with theories was he murdered killed by a tiger inexorably lost or was he kidnapped he was certainly rich but no one has ever asked for a ransom the most recent theory put forward in the film who killed jim thompson was that he was killed by rebels from the communist party of malaya number 7 db cooper this isnt his real name because no one knows what this mans real name is this brave criminal hijacked the boeing 727 in 1971 while i was in the sky flying to seattle during the flight he handed a message to the flight attendant that read miss youd better look at that note i have a bomb he then laid out some demands which included refueling when they landed him getting two hundred thousand dollars which is over a million dollars in todays money and a bunch of parachutes on landing in seattle he released most of the passengers but then took off again after getting what he had requested during the flight cooper jumped from the aircraft at a dangerous height he was never seen again but the fbi have kept the case open believing he may have gotten away with it and gone into hiding number six the crew of the mv joyita youve all heard of ghost ships right well this is one of the strangest stories of ships being found with the entire crew missing sailing in the south pacific in 1955 the ship was found but the 25 people that should have been aboard were nowhere to be seen okay so the ship wasnt in great condition but still no one can figure out why the entire would have abandoned her when she was certainly not going to sink the crew was never found number five mary celeste the ghost ship story that started them all was the tale of the mary celeste an american merchant ship that was found eerily floating without any crew in the middle of the atlantic ocean in 1872 when she was found it had been 10 days since anyone had written in the logbook and the ship was in fair condition just the 10 men werent there and they were never seen again all the food and water were there and a huge amount of alcohol that was worth a good sum of money was still in the cargo hold numerous stories have been put forth such as insurance fraud phenomenal disaster and most of all lots of paranormal tales have been written and discussed in formal investigations continue even to today number four the solder children this is a sad case of five missing children maurice 14 martha 12 lewis 9 jenny 8 and betty 5 whose faces could be seen on billboards in west virginia many years after they apparently vanished on the night before christmas in 1945 a fire broke out at their household while they were sleeping along with four of their other siblings as well as their parents at first it was thought that the five that remained two died but their bodies were never discovered it was believed the fire was not strong enough to totally cremate the bodies so what happened to them the parents later told the press about a lot of strange things happening prior to the fire including a mysterious man watching their kids a woman came forward during the search saying she had served them breakfast sometime after the fire while many other sightings were reported thats why a reward poster with the childrens faces on it could be seen in the area for many years to come it remains an unsolved mystery number three commie convers this american singersongwriter active in the 1950s apparently had been burned out at the end of her career something that often happens to those who acquire a certain amount of fame in august of 1974 she wrote a series of letters to friends and family explaining that it was time to start a new life to head to greener pastures she wrote in one letter human society fascinates me and awes me and fills me with grief and joy i just cant find my place to plug into it it sounds ominous but in another letter she asked someone to make sure her health insurance was fully paid she packed her clothes and drove away in her volkswagen beetle and was never seen again did she find those pastors or did she take her own life no one knows no  the missing village yes this is the case of an entire village going missing it happened in the early to mid 20th century and involves around 30 inuit people who lived at a site around anjikuni lake in a fairly remote part of canadas northern territories one night a tired trapper by the name of joe labelle whod been to the bustling village before decided he would take rest there only on this visit everyone was gone he did find a burning fire and on inspection of the houses found clothes valuables weapons and equipment that would have most definitely been needed had the people just decided to move on the food stores were all full  so what happened the canadian mounted police were called and they too were stumped they searched for months and never found the people outlandish theories have since been put forward including alien abduction although skeptics believe the whole story may have been a case of fake news even back when it was first reported the story is still being talked about in the media now so we dont know what to believe number 1 frederick valentich will finish up with an equally outlandish case and that is the disappearance of frederick valenta ch his disappearance is certainly not fake news but you might be skeptical as to the theories relating to his southern vanishing the australian pilot had been on a training flight in his cessna 182 l light aircraft on october 21st 1978 his last transmissions to radio control described that he was not alone in the sky and that a large object was above him its not an aircraft were his exact words he described this thing as orbiting above him and said it was shiny and metallic and even had a green light on top of it ground control then said they heard metallic scraping sounds and then poof it was gone a huge search ensued covering over 1000 square miles and neither the pilot nor the wreckage has ever been found there are rational theories for this strange case such as he was flying upside down and what he saw were reflections in the water it was also known that valenta ch was a ufo enthusiast ufoologists believed he was either killed by aliens or abducted others later came forward saying theyd seen strange things in the sky that evening but that was after the story hit the media we can be skeptical but even so this is one interesting case
__label__1 if youve been a viewer for long enough you may remember that one time that i had a little moment reminiscing about my old model m keyboard so far out of all the keyboards ive used in my life this is the best most solid overall feeling one other than i did have an ibm model m and nothing can compare and im not alone not only did someone else care enough to reupload that clip as its very own video but there is a healthy secondhand market for these things and you can even buy nearidentical brand new recreations today but in the age of bluetooth rgb and macros should you care lets find out speaking of random now you darn kids today might think that the model m looks like a basic oldschool keyboard but that is exactly why its special the layout that nearly every keyboard uses today is standard because of this keyboard from over 30 years ago not to be clear the qwerty layout has been around since the 1800s but by the time ibm was releasing personal computers in the 1980s keyboards needed a lot more keys than just letters and numbers and prior to the model m these keys could be found in all sorts of stupid and seemingly arbitrary places the reason that this board is different is that ibm put a lot of effort even developing a 10person task force into developing a friendlier keyboard letting focus groups rearrange and large or even duplicate commonly used keys the result was this board that looks totally normal except its missing windows keys and a couple of other things you see this isnt actually a model m per se this is the zeroeth generation ibm enhanced keyboard that launched in 1985 as part of the ibm 31 61 terminal thats why it doesnt have any lights for caps num or scroll lock those settings would be displayed on the terminal screen instead youll also notice that it has a fivepin din connector instead of a ps2 connector like other model ends this is significant because the model m launched with ibms personal system 2 or ps2 computer that is where the connector gets its name this is a secondgeneration model m the most popular it was manufactured back in 1987 just one year after i was born and we know this because every model m has a little birth certificate on its back but why do people still like these things so much after all these years well it comes down to feel sound and build quality model ms use switches that are very different to the cherry mx is that keyboard enthusiasts today might be used to in the patent these switches are actually called catastrophic ly buckling compression column switch and actuator but most normal people just call them buckling spring switches and thats because under each key cap there really is a little tiny spring so in the starting position the spring puts pressure on a rocker preventing it from closing the circuit but when you press the key down the spring eventually buckles tilting the rocker to contact a layer of membrane and registering your stroke at the precise instant that you feel the tactile feedback wait hold on did that say membrane yes model ems are often erroneously called mechanical keyboards but they are in fact membrane boards which is why they only have two key rollover just remember that this does not mean that they use rubber domes that is different or well okay actually some model ms do use rubber domes but more on that later anyway the result is a very balanced feel with a nice tactile bump and a 70 gram waiting for pure typists theres very little on the market even all these decades later that feels this good but while the buckling spring switches create auditory feedback that some people find very satisfying at least the ones doing the typing anyway they also take a long time to register repeated strokes making them unsuitable for competitive gaming though you could always just bludgeon your opponents over the head when you lose because the model ends are heavy boards the plastic shell and the key caps are made from hard pvc and pbt plastics that arent painted and dont yellow with age and inside theres a heat treated metal backplate thats responsible for the ends negligible deck flex and its fivepound heft at least they were five pounds thing is not all model ends are created equal in 1990 ibm sold part of its keyboard manufacturing division to what would become lexmark lexmark continued to make these keyboards for ibm but more cheaper this model m from 1995 demonstrates some of the changes including one good one drainage holes to protect it from its archnemesis water along with several less good ones like a lighter backplate and plastic shell a fixed instead of removable cable a monochrome legend on the key caps and rubber dome switches to be clear theyre good rubber domes but still anyway the keyboard gods work in mysterious ways and the growing popularity of rubber domes led to the collapse of the mechanical keyboard business with lexmark dropping their keyboard division outright in 1996 and here is where our story gets interesting a group of former ibm and lexmark employees began slowly purchasing the model ends intellectual property rights except for the logo and the physical manufacturing equipment that was used to make it the company they formed is called unit comp and thats where this came from its a unicom classic and it was manufactured on january 15th 2018 because of this heritage unicom model ends arent really clones but theyre more like descendants so how do they compare to the original well if you didnt spend the 80s and 90s typing on model ms when they were new its kind of hard to judge the feel of a brandnew unicom classic against an ibm board whose spring switches are 30 years older but even if you ask the people who have been using model ms for decades you will still get some who claim that the unit comps feel identical and others who claim that they feel very different and from a certain point of view theyre both right the eunich on boards are modeled after the last model that lexmark made so while they have the exact same switches as the early boards they are lighter weight and interestingly they can have imperfections on the case and less sharp lettering due to the aging mold and tooling equipment so our final take the eunich on boards are as close as you can get to brand new anyway to the original model m while also offering new color interface and key options all for less money than most keyboards of a similar quality so as a wellpriced typing board i can see the appeal but my money would go to either a more versatile cherry mx or an older generation model m off ebay even though i know that id be paying a pretty penny and i would probably need an adapter
