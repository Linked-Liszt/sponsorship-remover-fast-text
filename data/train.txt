__label__1 so this island here is north sentinel island and youre not allowed to visit it theres a few reasons why but first its important to know that north sentinel island is part of the greater andaman islands which are in the middle of the bay of bengal of roughly 1300 kilometers away from india and three hundred kilometers away from myanmar except for this tiny bit here the rest of the islands are governed by india and if that includes north sentinel island right here the people who inhabit the island are known as the sentinelese and even though their island is technically a part of india theyve probably never even heard of india or anywhere else for that matter you see the sentinelese are one of the very last remaining groups of people on earth that have remained virtually untouched and uncontacted from modern civilization they live a huntergatherer lifestyle surviving from fishing hunting and gathering plants similar to how all of our ancestors lived tens of thousands of years ago in the paleolithic era if the real world was like a game of civilization 5 then the sentinelese would not have even discovered agriculture yet which is the very first tech that you research in the game they also have still not discovered a way of producing fire so theyve been pretty isolated from the rest of human history and culture for untold thousands of years the strange thing about this society though is how close it exists to the modern world the island is only 50 kilometres away from port blair a modern city home to over 100000 people with an international airport a major naval base used by the indian navy and the seat of government for the andaman and nicobar islands territory the way this situation came to be is rather interesting the first known contact between the sentinelese and the outside world wasnt until the year 1867 in that year an indian merchant ship crashed on a reef near the island the crew escaped to the beach and were attacked by the locals who were seeing the first other humans in their entire civilizations history they survived one another passing ship rescued them and periodic contacts were made by the british until 1887 from then on nobody from the outside world managed to make contact with them again until in 1970 when the indian government sent a group of anthropologists who spotted them on the beach tragedy struck in 1974 when a national geographic team went to the island to shoot a documentary and got attacked by volleys of arrows as their boat got too near the beach the director was struck by an arrow in his thigh and the crew retreated afterwards in 1981 a ship wrecked itself on the north side of the island which can still be seen there today on google maps they radioed for urgent help after they spotted the sentinelese building boats on the beach armed with javelins and arrows but help didnt come for two weeks eventually they were all rescued by helicopter and the first actual peaceful contact between them and the outside world finally occurred in 1991 with a group of indian anthropologists but the indian government decided to stop any further expeditions to the island in 1997 out of fear of introducing diseases that the sentinelese would have no immunities against like what happened in a few other places around the world previously to this and just because the risk of getting attacked by them was considered too great they survived the indian ocean tsunami in 2004 after helle kapur sent to check up on them was warned away by a warrior with a bow and ultimate tragedy struck in the year 2006 when two fishermen who were illegally fishing in the waters near the island fell asleep and had their boat drifted just a little too close to the beach sentinelese archers killed the men and when a helicopter came to recover their bodies it was also attacked by a volley of arrows and driven away in the aftermath of these incidents the indian government has banned all travel to the island and declared a three mile exclusion zone around it which is enforced by their navy that is the reason why youll probably never get to set foot on this island and even if you could you probably wouldnt even want to the latest indian census of the island tried to estimate their population and calculated it to be around 40 but other estimates place the true population somewhere between 50 and 400 people whatever the number the last people from the outside world that visited the island was in 2006 and neither lived to talk about it but imagine what the perspective of these islanders must be like when that ship crashed on the island back in 1981 it may have accidentally kickstarted the iron age for their civilization as they have been observed to be scavenging the wreckage for iron that they now use in their arrow tips to them their island is their universe and the outside world is as far away as the stars and space our to our civilization we are there aliens with incomprehensible technology and languages and we have much to learn from how theyve reacted to us so far we cant say for certain when or if contact with the sentinelese will occur again but what

__label__1 our first sleeper pc we nicknamed danny hubert rocked dual gtx 1080s and intel core i 9 processor and hardline liquid cooling crammed into a pretty old antic case so how do we oneup something like that haha meet huberts brother dale sure dale is a bit smaller and way older but dont let his outward appearance fool you because this build sponsored by intel is about as fast as a gaming pc can be in 2017 music we knew that for a small formfactor sleeper we needed a really unique case as a starting point and our good friends over at free geek vancouver were able to provide just that they have everything there this morrow designs md3 hails from 1982 making it older than literally everyone in our office and it has clearly seen better days with its dual floppy bass and 8bit operating system this puppy would have cost about three thousand dollars back in its day but it hasnt worked in years and even if it did it is basically useless now cracking it open other than this massive dust bunny its really not that bad though all things considered so with the internals removed it was time to do some test fitting now unfortunately a full sized high end gpu is just a bit too long to fit but zotac had exactly the right medicine this mini gt x 1080 ti with a water cooling block so i guess well have to water cool the system now then thats not gonna be easy in such a small space and were gonna be limited to a thick single radiator but were hoping that thats going to be enough which brings us to the best part of every mod angle grinding from the factory theres mounting for literally no modern hardware so all of the cutouts for io and mounting had to be created from scratch for the motherboard here it was basically a case of cut a bunch out with the angle grinder then come in with the dremel for a while and finally finish off with a hand file this one hole here actually took close to four hours since there was no going back if we slipped up now in 1982 120 mil fans for pcs were not a thing at all so we needed a new fan hole with some help from this cable management tie we cut it out using the cannibal and then at this stage we also drilled lots of holes for everything to mount on the bottom we decided to position the gpu above the motherboard this ended up be a bit tricky because originally we were going to use this 3d printed bracket but it was really ugly and not in like a cool vintage way so we opted to very slowly create mounting points for the backplate and holes for the io to fasten it directly to the back of the chassis instead bringing us to test fit time and it looks good now for the front of the floppy drives just to be sure and oh crap oh i guess that interferes with the radiator no worries though just a little bit of hole and viggen mint and dale is off to get a fresh coat of paint but only on the inside on that topic lets talk about whats under the hood for the cpu we went with intels core i7 8700 k making dil as good as it gets for gaming for our motherboard we chose an asus z3 70 i gaming with a samsung nvme ssd underneath this sexy heatsink then to keep the cpu cool were using an ek supremacy full nickel block we decided against an acrylic block since itll actually have to help hold up the graphics card and also because you wont be able to see it anyway for our radiator we went with a 120 millimeter single rad from alpha cool that is a massive 60 millimeters thick and then for our pump were using an ek spc 60 with a built in cylindrical reservoir we went with these super sexy white fittings and black acrylic tube both provided by bits power for a sleek monochrome look the first bend was one of the hardest since it needs to come around our pci express extender and then make a funky bend too so we ended up just making a little steak out of black fittings in hopes that nobody would notice right here the bending wasnt finished yet though next this 90 degree from the pump to the res and after that a nice long tube from the gpu back to the radiator both of which were made the perfect length with a bit of help from the bench sander now we just need to do a bunch of little touchups to make it perfect like splicing together the led for the drives so they can be attached to the hard drive header soldering on the front panel connector that we borrowed from another case so that the og power button and led would still work gently removing the print and modem ports massaging them with the sander before inserting them and then finally screwing and doublesided taping the fronts to the floppy drives back in their original positions the insides we finished off with this sweet purple cathode from bits power and unbelievable 800 watt 80plus titanium sf xl modular power supply from silverstone and some cleanup from ivan the cable management king perfect now lets fill the loop making sure to use a secondary power supply so that in the unlikely event that we have a spill seriously you guys forgot a plug on the radiator oh man i mean it at least it wasnt out in the open im an idiot yes but now youre not alone my friend so my team of skilled boaters remove the rad added a plug and tightened everything down aha no i leaked it dad what are you guys even doing this time the tubing is full no veries though what youre looking at right now is a perfectly legitimate strategy for emptying a loop by the way yes perfectly legitimate totally not weird so after swapping out some of the fittings third times a charm we were finally leakfree to see how dale runs and performance wise oh it runs idle temps are in the 20s and then under full synthetic load on the cpu and gpu for half an hour with the lid closed dale held steady at 80 degrees with the cpu still turbo eng  4 gigahertz on all six cores though it should be noted that he did get a little loud in this scenario as for games though here things got even more impressive dale in spite of his looks can drag race with it any challenger he is one of the fastest small form factor computers on the market with frames per second in the hundreds on ultra and even during heavy extended gaming sessions he stayed reasonably quiet with gpu temperatures maxing out at 53 degrees so lets bask then in the glory of dale and look out for our next addition to the sleeper family margaret music
__label__1 it is official my friends the bankruptcy auction of my former employer ncix calm has begun its today ive got my voter card this is my registration so its the previewing day were gonna go in were gonna see whats what and then were actually gonna come back tomorrow the ncix tektips gold play button is in there thats my bit i want that and im sure im gonna find some other stuff to check this out for any unfilled orders please contact your credit card company to charge back we are sorry for any inconvenience were done were done all right lets go so ive been to auctions run by these guys before and it was at their facility and everything was kind of like put into bins and carts but on location the rules are a little different like even at the checkin desk the computers here theyre up for auction you you just you go ever like is this toilet plunger up for auction no no its not okay so not everything but a lot of things so in here is where they used to assemble all the ncix pc computers i was actually in here must have been a month or two ago and i was chatting with the the owner former owner i dont know how that works but i was in here and it was like crazy like basically screwdrivers down it looked like everyone went home for the day and then just never came back so theyve theyve kind of staged things a little bit make it look a little more you know auctioning it looks like any machines that were in the process of being built and or like this ones got a lot of dust in it look at this and or i dont know maybe were in for repair or were being used as demo systems have just kind of been set up all along the counters here for people to to bid on them some pretty good stuff in here so the way that these auctions work is everything is kind of grouped into lots so you cant just bid on this sapphire hd 2600 xt as though you would want to if you got to buy this one terabyte two and a half inch hard drive this test blank no way there is so much like epic loot here look at this alien where compu mm stress balls this is doing nothing for my stress right now you could do like a techie archaeological dig in this place and that was already true when i left five years ago please keep this door closed what are you gonna do about it alright ok this is fun we found a home for the thresh ball i found on the floor stress stress is all gone now and weve got some other good stuff here too so this this was my bad like 8 years ago i cut a pio for this this is the mountain mods its uv green acrylic stylish that that stayed fashionable uv green acrylic and its an external radiator mount with like these handles on the top so you would basically like separate them and then you would screw in your radiator on both sides and you could just mount the radiator and just plonk it down on your desk needless to say that concept didnt really take off and making matters worse if you were to buy one of these today i hope you have a thermo chill pa series radiator because otherwise it wont fit and those have been discontinued for over half a decade so sorry ncix i done goofed on that one another thing i bought that never sold these that mod smart these were the primo chill guys sometimes they moved ok some colors though not as successful as others more danger den stuff oh no an am to hold down for the swift x storm oh ok heres another good one i guarantee you i bought this to apple gd t yep so i actually cut my teeth as a product manager on the water cooling category because no one else wanted to do it look at that yellow label there baby this is the db one from d tech do you guys remember d tech i didnt think so danny from d tech good guy good guy man they made the best barbs in the game back when barbed fittings were cool this is a fun bin if you want some truly legacy stuff like this looks really good but this is a gtx 760 and this doesnt even look good but its like funnier than it than it looks it looks like a crappy graphics card uhhuh its a pci card this is a this x card physics by ageia physx this is the future okay i need to find out how much the minimum bid is because like i just want to do a retro unboxing of office xp professionals still sealed adobe illustrator cs2 clearly not worth anything but im terrible now that is a dead operating system if ive ever seen one hey ive got an ipad  heres a pink case for it as long as im willing to buy 30 of them and also holy crap theres like a couple hundred cases for the galaxy note not the note 3 or note 5 or no 8 the original galaxy note oops that wasnt me this stuff okay so the way these things work like everything is as is where it is so a box like this might be a treasure trip oh check this out this is e 270 something no x 99 not z 270 so like whatever is in here is in here huh also not z 270 thats another x 99 board its got like laptops laptops for days in here and boxes for like phones and stuff too like is this a blackberry phone no see empty box but this feels like there could be a p9  inside and there isnt so you go youre gonna go through this stuff pretty carefully one thing i know for sure though is that craigslist is going to be flush with hardware deals hardware deals for days on craigslist with markup after this auction i mean it is kind of depressing to think about it being reduced to this like to the point where your promotional pens are in a bin for auction one day this music now this kind of stuff is sad like i remember irene i worked with irene she doesnt have a job anymore yeah she was really nice i guess i didnt really have anywhere to go with that ya know i actually have a good where to go with that thats kind of a bummer what irene stuff is in here a sears bag and some gloves holy is this all of the customer records this isnt for sale right throw away okay yeah good i shred hopefully ok so heres all the good stuff heres a bunch of like current motherboards x 370 pros like heres a rampage 5 edition 10 its like a 600 700 dollar board heres all the graphics cards that are worth anything as well so your ten sixties 10 70s i mean this should give you some idea how bad the gpu shortage was that a retailer went out of business and had literally 20 graphics cards it stuck oh wow theyve still got one of the watercooled fx processors oh and a core i7 extreme from like four or five years ago ouch you can buy all the lunch room chairs lunch room microwaves minifridge this is the aquarium as i called it or the boardroom i just felt like i felt like a fish sitting in here this was the ceos office so apparently he set it up with a projector at some point it wasnt like this last time i was here but ive had a couple of actually ive had a couple of very tense meetings in this room so someone had told me that the gold play button was in the ceos office but i didnt see it there do you know if the gold youtube play button is here okay so im messaging my old boss because i really want that gold play button but in the meantime we did get some clarification on this one there is an auction lot for it but here get get wide because theres a lot of stuff i got to show here to buy it i have to buy all of these awards all of this crap this dinosaur this basketball signed by dirk meyer this tv this stand and these two plants over here really for a silver button i might be better off just telling you guys go subscribe to linus cat tips try and get another twenty thousand subs over there get a cat tips play button its been a long time since ive been here so it wasnt the wisest move ever but yep it was my call to do half of the room green screen green and half of it so this is actually the original chroma key blue and then they repainted this one for when the other team moved over here after they got booted out of their previous studio if we uh the idea was wed be able to green or blue screen in this room but what happened in practice was we just ended up with a lot of green cast on everything that we shot on the blue wall this will be the last time i ever walked through here i havent been here in like well over two years three years huh well i guess this is as good a place as any to end our tour i guess well be back tomorrow with bidding what are we gonna buy

__label__1 so theres this fantastic wikipedia list descriptively titled wikipedia  unusual articles i just remember it as that wikipedia list its a collection of hundreds of articles about unusual unexpected and unbelievable subjects no matter what link you click its bound to be interesting for that reason every week im gonna click on a new link and teach you a little bit more about our amazing world this number is illegal well kinda i switch it a few digits to protect myself since you know its illegal but just the possession of this number is enough to get you arrested in the us to understand why we need to learn some cryptology prime numbers are numbers that can only be divided by themselves and one for example nothing multiplies together to get seven other than seven and one nothing multiplies together to get 29 other than 29 and one this will be the same for all primes its not that hard to check if a smaller number is prime for seven you just check if seven divided by one is a whole number 7 divided by 2 by 3 by 4 by 5 by 6 nothing other than 7 can divide 7 into a whole number as you get to bigger and bigger numbers you have to check more and more times to determine if a number is prime that means that its exceedingly difficult to find new primes the largest prime number that we know of right now is 2 to the power of 74 million two hundred seven thousand two hundred and eighty one minus one theres an infinite number of primes since theres an infinite number of numbers but it just takes an enormous amount of computing power to find these primes so whats the point of finding primes well theyre actually quite useful for encryption for the sake of simplicity lets take two small primes 11 and 13 if we were actually encrypting data we would be using primes with thousands of digits but that would probably make this explanation a little complicated now multiply 11 and 13 together in your head you can probably figure out pretty easily that together they make 143 now how long would it take you to work backwards and figure out what multiplies together to get 143 probably a pretty long time its the same with computers its very easy for them to multiply two numbers together and find out what the product is but its very hard for them to take the product and find out what the factors are when youre logging on to say your bank account online the computer will send the number 143 which is known as the public key to the bank server the bank will then check if 11 and 13 the private keys multiply to 143 and if so it will let you in everyone has the public key but only the bank has the private keys if you wanted to find the private keys you would need a computer to factor the public key which would take thousands of years because once again in the real world the keys are an 11 and 13 theyre prime numbers with thousands upon thousands of digits with the amount of money that it would take to set up a computer system that could actually factor the primes its just not worth it the bigger the prime number the longer it takes to factor and the more secure it is thats why organizations like the electronic frontier foundation are willing to pay up to two hundred and fifty thousand dollars for new prime numbers alright thats all the math were gonna do today i promise back to our legal number in 1998 the digital millennium copyright act was passed in the us making it illegal to circumvent copyright measures and to produce or distribute tools that could be used to get around copyright systems our legal number eight five six five zero seven eight and so on and so forth is a prime number that is the source code used to decrypt the copyright protection of dvds the copyright protection was used to stop people from downloading or duplicating movies on their computers and with this number the protection was rendered useless programs were created that allowed individuals to make bootleg copies of movies all because of this number all the while individuals are breaking the law not only by copying dvds but also just by being in possession of this number an easily findable prime

__label__1 just twelve years ago in 2006 marked the 200 year anniversary since the death of the holy roman empire one of the longest existing empires in world history i say empire in air quotes because the history of the holy roman empire and the way it operated is incredibly complicated and calling it an empire is actually fairly controversial and so is calling it roman and so is calling it holy anyway what would the world look like if the holy roman empire was for whatever reason resurrected today if the empires borders were recreated at the height of the historical imperial territory in 1155 then the empire would encompass practically all of modernday germany austria switzerland the czech republic slovenia luxembourg and the netherlands while also occupied territory taken from belgium france italy croatia poland and russia territory from 13 total countries figuring out where the capital city of this empire would be is pretty difficult since the historic empire never actually had one and was usually just based on where the current emperor was residing if the old government of the empire came back into modern day it would mean that the emperor would be an elected office maybe the citizens would elect this person or a group like the electoral college would but either way the 10 biggest cities in the empire would be mostly concentrated in germany and italy with a top five biggest being munich homburg vienna rome and berlin the population of the modern empire would be approximately 215 million people which is fascinating when you consider what the population of the empire was just a few centuries ago in 1618 before the 30 years war the empire was home to just 21 million people and true the territory then was smaller than in my modern example but 21 million people is only about a quarter of modern germanys population alone in 1648 after the 30 years war the empires population shrank to just 16 million meaning that in 30 years of war nearly one out of every four people died imagine similar disaster happening today and even further the largest city 400 years ago in 1600 wasnt even in the top five today prague pragues population then was just a hundred thousand people in viennas was only 50 thousand vienna today has nearly 2 million so the numbers of people living inside the imperial borders has definitely grown in the century since but what about the demographics of that population its probably changed a little but its still dominated by the germans and the italians heres the empires modern ethnic diversity where you can clearly see the percentage of germans italians and french and then heres the linguistic diversity for you to compare that to which looks pretty similar with the german italian and french languages being unsurprisingly the most spoken while those are probably pretty similar to how they used to be the religious composition of the modern empire is certainly radically different christians only make up 58 percent of the modern empires territory split between 45 catholics and 13 protestants nonreligious people in atheists make up the next largest bloc at a massive 33 percent of the population while muslims make up what is certainly another large increase from hundreds of years ago at 3 of the current population the modern holy roman empire would also have an enormous economy with a nominal gdp of 92 3 2 trillion us dollars mostly owing to wealthy areas like germany the netherlands belgium and northern italy this makes the empire the third largest economy in the world beating out japan but staying just behind china this huge economy and population also means the imperial military would be quite formidable with a budget of 109 billion dollars in an active force of 694 thousand soldiers with an additional million in reserves thats the worlds sixth largest standing army ahead of south korea and the third largest budget but that budget is only about half of what the current european union combined spent on defense about 200 billion dollars overall the holy roman empire in the modern world would be an absolute powerhouse it would dominate european politics and with an economy close in size to chinas in a population larger than russia it could have aspirations of achieving global superpower status

__label__1 the original inspiration for this video came when alex craftily turned the surface laptop hed just finished writing the review for into his daily driver and realized that our model unfortunately only has 8 gigs of ram with no way to upgrade it but does that matter well the commonly held wisdom for years has been that unless youre some kind of power user 8 gigs ought to be enough for everyone well hold on with windows 10 and chrome devouring memory like kobayashi at a hotdogeating contest weve been regularly seeing memory usage over 20 gigs just from web browsing on our writing workstations so we started an investigation ek waterblock says music so our testing rig has a core i7 7700 k a gtx 1080i and a one terabyte sata ssd then we equipped it with 4 8 16 or 32 gigabytes of ram at each stage we tracked page file usage with performance monitor then opened up tasks until we noticed activity once you reach the threshold where the system starts to swap data out of bran and onto the boot drive you might not necessarily see the system slow to a crawl or anything like that but you could see a dip in performance or responsiveness if a tab or an application that you go to access has already been paged to your ssd or your hard drive so first up is chrome will be looking both at how many chrome tabs are open when windows starts using the page file and how many are open when chrome eventually becomes unusable bear in mind that not all tabs behave identically ive seen some use two gigs of ram on their own but we chose a mix of web pages that we feel should be representative of typical browsing behavior with four gigs of ram we actually hit the page file with just five tabs open and then after 13 chrome crashed alrighty then with eight gigs we got to a respectable 25 tabs before any of them got swapped out and managed 40 before the situation went totally south with 16 gigs of ram we reached a fairly unreasonable 80 tabs open before page filing and then chrome finally crashed at around a hundred and eighty then with 32 gigs of ram we got all the way to a hundred and sixtyfive tabs before paging and frankly we didnt feel like going through the actually kind of laborious process of opening and loading 350 to 400 web pages in chrome tabs just to see the program fail i mean if you want that many tabs youre kind of doing it wrong and this is coming from me so lets move then into gaming if all youre doing is playing a game i think you might actually be surprised by how little ram you actually need deus ex mankind divided for example which recommends 12 gigs of ram didnt suffer too badly even with only a single four gig stick although with that said rise of the tomb raider had some serious issues that were only sorted out by bumping up to eight gigs of ram after that though performance didnt change for either of them when we jumped to 16 or 32 games so ok then 8 gigs for gamers actually maybe not i mean what if you dont painstakingly close down all of your running applications every time you launch steam for those folks we popped open our 10 tab test suite and an instance of discord to see if 8 gigs could handle it and surprisingly enough there was no difference at all with the exception of rise of the tomb raider that game seems to really love its ran so then depending on the game you probably wont need 16 gigs of ram to play it but it wont give you a ton of breathing room for the future and you might need to limit your background tasks for the best experience so then what does anyone need more than 8 gigs of ram for well i would argue that any kind of workstation is going to want at least 16 and you might be surprised to find out that even more is pretty common for those kinds of systems alex actually has a number of excel documents from his engineering days that believe it or not will not even open on a computer with 8 gigs of ram and has had some simulations of fluid flow or suspension movement that crash out even with 16 gigs of ram video editing can also be very demanding but this is heavily dependent on your workload if youre cutting together short to medium length 1080p videos 16 gigs should be plenty but the sky is the limit here if you use tools like after effects you can expect needing 16 to be an absolute minimum and as the complexity of your project increases so does your ram requirements our latest season of scrapyard wars for example because of how darn much footage was in the timeline immediately crashes we anything less than 64 gigs of ram although for more information about how much ram you need through video editing specifically you can check out our video here where we tested it with up to 128 now it should be noted that all of what im saying concerns system memory and not video memory which is used for loading in 3d objects and textures for your graphics cards used this is very important for games and also professional applications but is probably a discussion for a different video when i can almost guarantee well end with well it depends one interesting side note before we wrap up is that as we moved up from four gigs of ram our system boot times actually got slower it was only at most a second more but this is cool if youre aware of a windows feature called super fetch it actually makes sense super fetch tries to intelligently preload some programs into ram so that theyll launch faster when you need them so the idea is that if you run out and buy excess memory it can still be used for something which doesnt mean though that were saying to do that as you might have noticed ram prices are out of control right now so our recommendation for general users and gamers is eight gigs if youre looking to scrape by and be ready to upgrade later and 16 gigs if you want to be comfortable for a while as for the workstation users out there well it depends and you know what else it depends on yeah it doesnt depend on that at all forget it course so thanks for watching guys if this video sucked you know what to do but if it was awesome

__label__1 okay so first lets get one thing straight count dracula wasnt a real person he was the creation of writer bram stoker in his 1897 novel dracula but stoker didnt pull dracula out of thin air the myth of the vampire had been circulating around mostly eastern europe for centuries sometimes leading to accusations of vampirism and the public and a few brave but perhaps demented people digging up corpses and plunging a stake into a stopped heart there are reports of people doing this in serbia in the early 1700s but tales of soul destroying blood sucking dudes with a fine set of shiny incisors are thought to have originated in antiquity if you type vampire arrested into google youll quickly see that the vampiric age is not dead but today were going to focus on a real devil in this episode of the infographic show  tomo miyazaki the human dracula miyazaki is also sometimes referred to as the girl killer which explains clearly how he entered the serial killer hall of infamy you could say hes almost the japanese version of jeffrey dahmer if you switch teenage boys for very young girls like dahmer miyazaki had a thing for expressing a twisted adoration of dead bodies this is our way of describing necrophilia without veering too much into the realm of xrated content he also ate parts of them for dinner yes he was a cannibal but how did this maniac transform from cute little japanese boy  wretched killer of kids lets take a brief look at his past if youve seen our other serial killer shows you can bet he didnt have the best start in life his rotten luck started the moment he took his first breath but if you want to be more precise it started while he was still in the womb he was born on august 21st 1962 which makes him a leo we actually looked up famous serial killers and their star signs and gemini had the most so if you are a gemini you are in some bad company okay sorry about the digression so this guy was born with very deformed hands not only was it hard for him to use them but they looked like the hands of nosferatu long and thin and gnarled and utterly creepy looking as you might imagine this didnt go down well with the girls and it was an endless stream of amusement for young boys that liked to bully him it said miyazaki soon learned it was best to stay alone that he did while reading fantasy comics and watching slasher films only he soon graduated from comics and horror movies  watching japanese pornography it was later discovered he had amassed over five thousand seven hundred sixty three of these screamadelica videos and as weird as they can be it wasnt enough and soon he was into anime and illegal films whose victims were children he once said about normal japanese pornography they black out the most important part they werent good enough for him and aside from searching for and finding illegal videos he filmed girls underwear when he managed to get shots while they were playing tennis at a nearby court the thing is this was a kid with opportunities his dad owned a newspaper but miyazaki wasnt interested in taking it over he was a black sheep as well as a lonely cripple he watched videos all the time rather than work and it said the two sisters that lived with him didnt like him at all his dad never listened to him and his mother wasnt exactly dodie the one person he did have was his grandfather whom he loved so much he ate part of his ashes after he died so he could stay with him forever things went downhill after the death of grandpa on one occasion miyazaki was caught spying on one of his sisters as she showered she expressed her concern and rather than apologized he beat her up his mother admonished him for crime one and crime two and so he beat her up too you get the picture this is one unhappy kid as is the case with so many abused kids who attempt to gain power and control in their lives he soon turned to murder and so on august 22nd 1988 miyazaki abducted a fouryearold from a park in tokyo he took her to a quiet spot under a bridge and the two chatted for around 30 minutes he then strangled her and proceeded to engage in sexual acts with her corpse he stripped her and took home her clothes only a few days later he had a change of mind and went back to the decomposing body he chopped off her hands and feet which would later be discovered in his closet he took the rest of the body earned it and ground the bones into powder he then sent some of this powder to the girls parents along with a few of her teeth and some photos of her clothes he sent a postcard to which cryptically read marry cremated bones investigate proof soon after he did the same with a sevenyearold girl who had been walking around by herself again he engaged in necrophilia and he did that at the exact same spot where he had done it before he kept the clothes again for later gratification he took his third victim another four year old just a couple of months after he drove her to the prefecture of saitama to a parking lot and took photos of her while she was alive he dumped her body there and left her clothes closeby in a green area again he sent the parents a postcard but this time he used letters cut out from magazines the postcard cryptically read erica cold coffee throat rest death it said that a passing driver saw the two together and if hed have done something he could have stopped the murder but he drove on soon after the girl was strangled its also said that his car got stuck in a gutter where he had stopped and then taken the dead girl from the car after he had dumped her a bunch of guys helped him get his car out because of all the things that went wrong he waited a while before he next struck but about six months later he took a wandering fiveyearold girl from a park he took her to his car killed her then covered her in a sheet and took her home with him there he spent two days molesting the dead girl and he took photos and videos of this the videos were later found in his room when decomposition made it impossible for him to further exploit her body he chopped her up he dumped the torso and head in separate locations and kept the hands he admitted to eating part of these hands and drinking blood from her but he got paranoid and soon dumped what was left of the hands he got caught soon after this when he was attempting to insert a zoom lens of a camera inside a young girls vagina or according to another report just in between her legs he was trying this in a park it said but the girls dad turned up hit miyazaki and he ran off absolutely naked the dad reported him of course and when cops went to miyazakis house to confront him they found his stash of terrible homemade videos as well as all the other sexual videos police also later found some girls hands it said during his trial he showed no remorse whatsoever and even once said that he had done a good job he said he was a japanese hero and during the trial he thought he was on stage he refused to apologize for what he had done compelling some people to think he was insane courtappointed psychiatrists had two different opinions one that he had a personality disorder but knew exactly what he was doing and another that his mind was not working correctly during his reign of terror in jip thats called having a feeble mind and if the judge agreed with that the sentence would be more lenient but the judge believed the first diagnosis and he was sentenced to death considering the cruelty of his crimes their social impact and the sentiments of the victims kin capital punishment is unavoidable said the judge this was in spite of miyazaki saying he had felt as though he was dreaming when he committed the murders and that he had been hallucinating about something he called the rat people one psychiatrist said he may not have an incapacitating personality disorder such as paranoia or schizophrenia but i think he may be borderline his rich father didnt offer any money to help with his sons defense as he said it would have been an insult to the victims families in fact in true japanese style the father took his own life a few years later after this huge loss of honour it said after his arrest miyazaki wrote a letter to his dad blaming him for everything to his mom he simply wrote mother ive caused you much heartache dont forget to change the oil in my car or it will get so that you cant drive it before he was executed he told more of his story saying how being hated or just ignored by his parents and his sisters made his life miserable it turned out he hurt animals as many serial killers do before they turn their attention to human flesh he strangled his pet dog to death and killed two cats one of which he boiled to death after some retrials relating to the mans sanity his death sentence was upheld and miyazaki was hanged on june 17 2008 so what are some of your thoughts was that the right decision by the court could a man that mad have been rehabilitated what do you think should happen to criminals that commit such vile crimes also be sure to check out our other video called americas strangest serial killer ed gein
__label__1 the reality is that if theyre having to pay more for the pilots to serve small towns
__label__1 did three free months of speeding through airport security with clear airlines are notoriously difficult businesses to run each and every flight operated is a multithousand dollar gamble on whether or not passengers will buy tickets aside from cost the strongest factor for customers on which flight they will take is often the overall travel time so airlines put enormous effort into properly assembling their puzzle of flights so they can offer the shortest connection time possible with so many destinations all across the world its just natural that most routes require connections so airlines need to attract connecting passengers in order to stay in business now most like connections for traditional airlines happen out of their hub airports american airlines for example has 10 across the united states and every single one of their flights either begins or ends at these airports but not all hubs are created equal charlotte douglas reagan national and laguardia are largely built for northsouth traffic and terminating traffic miami is for connecting north american travelers to flights to the caribbean and south america philadelphia is a bit of a hybrid hub connecting both northsouth traffic and north american traffic on two flights to europe jfk is the major hub for connecting north american traffic to european flights and the los angeles hubs main purpose is to connect north american traffic to asia and oceania bound flights but then there are these three chicago ohare dallasfort worth and phoenix sky harbor airports these three airports are the truly important connection airports since they lie between the coast and their schedules reflect this the eastwest routes are the most competitive in the united states so american has to offer short connections in order to dominate the market so what american airlines has done is that theyve banked their hubs what this means is that for the most part all their flights arrive and depart at roughly the same time for example on any given wednesday in the fall the philadelphia flight will arrive at 1114 am than the atlanta flight at 1117 am the dc one at 1129 and the nashville flight at 1145 then at 1240 the flight to denver leaves at 1245 the one in las vegas at 100 the one to san francisco and at 110 the flight to los angeles this way nobody has to wait for longer than two hours to connect almost every flight american operates in and out of dfw falls into one of their ten daily banks this is how the airline gets those connecting passengers by offering shorter connection times nearby dallas love field is southwest airlines main hub but it operates in an entirely different way it just has planes arriving and leaving at a consistent average of about eight to twelve flights per hour all day long and theres a good reason for this southwest is a budget airline bangs hubs are significantly more expensive to run because they require more resources the airline needs to have enough equipment people and gates to turn around all their planes at the same time if the planes came in at a smooth pace all the people and equipment could be used continuously but at a big tub the airlines still needs to pay for the people and equipment during the downtime between the banks if a plane leaves philadelphia bound for dc at 930 with a 900 to 1000 am bank it will arrive around 10 am but it will have to wait to leave until about 1115 to time its arrival with the 1145 to 1245 bank planes cost money whether theyre in the air or sitting on the ground so having planes wait around to time with banks cost money too this is why a budget airline will never schedule their planes to sit on the ground during the day for more than an hour once a plane lands it immediately loads up and takes off again as soon as possible for this reason the planes of a budget airline like spirit airlines are in the air for an average of 11 hours per day while american airlines only uses their planes for an average of 85 hours per day bangs hubs can also make delays more probable when there are so many planes going out at once an airport might just not be able to cope with a surge in activity if a thunderstorm hits an airport for example a whole bank of flights might be delayed or canceled which would create a knockon effect all across the country these banking systems are essentially a higher risk higher reward in terms of delays but some airlines have taken the bank tub concept to an extreme at the odd airways hub in abu dhabi essentially operates with just two big bang a day almost all their flights from the west arrived between 700 and 830 pm then eastbound flights depart between 930 and 1030 pm flights coming in from the east land between about 1130 pm and 1230 am and then the final bank of westbound flights departs between 200 and 330 am with this system almost every flight from europe or the us can connect to a flight to asia or australia in no more than two hours the whole operation also takes about eight and a half hours perfectly timed for one work shift but of course however this leads to a lot of planes sitting around their flight to hong kong for example departs at 950 pm abu dhabi time and arrives at 1005 am hong kong time the plane then has to sit around until 655 pm in order to time its arrival with the rest of the westbound bank thats almost nine hours of waiting but in order to scheduled flights correctly its fairly typical for planes to sit around flights from north to south america are notoriously difficult to schedule salle paulo brazil is only one hour ahead of new york during daylight saving time so southbound flights tend to leave in the evening and arrive 10 hours later in the morning but the tricky part is when the flight should return if the flight left at 7 pm and arrive the following morning at 6 am it could turn around and fly back at 9 am and arrive at 6 pm but the airline doesnt want to do that the problem is that airlines rely heavily on connecting traffic to fill their flights and find the time arriving travelers got off the plane and made it through customs it would be 730 pm at best by which time the majority of flights have left for the night airlines therefore almost universally decide to leave their planes on the ground in south america all day to fly back overnight so travelers can connect onwards to our final destination on morning flights this is likely part of the reason why flights from north to south america are so expensive but some of the airlines have found a way to take advantage of the time on the ground labor is significantly cheaper in south america so airlines have started to perform maintenance work on planes while theyre waiting around for the evening flight back american airlines for well recently started building a 100 million dollar hanger in sao paulo to support their maintenance operations there qantas made a similar move to take advantage of time on the ground by opening up an a380 size maintenance hangar in los angeles for their planes that sometimes sit there for up to 14 hours but thats not the only trick qantas has of its leaves australia is just so isolated that no plane can currently fly nonstop from the country to the us east coast the us west coast however is close enough that a plane can make it in a 12 to 14 hour flight so qantas has nonstop flights from melbourne sydney and brisbane to los angeles the trick is that they are all scheduled to arrive between about 600 and 630 am then at 820 am one of the planes continues on to new york with the passengers booked through this is known as a scissor hub westjet operates an even more advanced one in st johns canada they have flights arriving from orlando toronto and ottawa all around 930 to 1000 pm then just past 11 their flights to dublin and london leaves this way they can fly 6 routes with just three planes and even better for them since its only a four and a half hour flight from st johns to the british isles they can fly small inexpensive singleaisle planes transatlantic all of these scheduled patterns and tricks serve to help an airline achieve its ultimate goal to maximize revenue in this industry time truly is money since planes cost money and people pay more to fly faster so few aspects of the business are as important as properly scheduling flights if you like spending less time at airports one way is to fly with shorter connections but perhaps the easiest way is to use clear i tried them out for myself on a recent trip and the footage speaks for itself clear uses biometrics to replace the tsa id check so you always go straight to either the precheck or regular screening without waiting in line as you can see here it took me exactly one minute and 7 seconds to go from walking in the door of a guardia to getting into security the xray was completely backed up with a few people in wheelchairs when i went through but thats actually a good thing because what i am showing you here is the absolute worst case scenario the slowest security with clear will be i put my camera in my bag during the screening so that tsa agents wouldnt yell at me but the timer is still running so even with all that backup at the xray i went from walking through the door to the gate in seven minutes

__label__1 its 4 am on a midaugust morning in the northern california wilderness during a brief overnight storm lightning strikes the top of a hill ignites some dry underbrush and starts a wildfire it isnt until 6 am as the sun rises that someone notices the fire a hiker camping on an overlooking hill as soon as the hikers 911 received by the emergency dispatch center they contact cal fire the agency responsible for wildfire protection and management in california by 630 they call the redding californiabased smokejumpers they are one of the most elite firefighting squads in the united states there are only 400 smoke jumpers in the us and 40 of those are based here in redding california theyre essentially the rapid response team for wildfires within 15 minutes of receiving the call these monk jumpers are in their plane and taking off it takes just 20 minutes to fly the 50 miles to the fire site where they find a suitable tree free landing spot jump deploy their parachutes and land the plane then circles back to parachute down boxes of equipment smoke jumpers carry with them enough supplies to last 72 hours completely self supported food water shelter safety equipment and firefighting tools they follow the ridgeline and make their way to the fire now this is a small team and they need to decide how to prioritize what they do with the fire already having grown to 15 acres the team knows theyre unlikely to stop it on their own backups are already on the way so their priority is to slow it down as much as possible there are four major factors that affect how fast a fire moves how much fuel there is how wet the fuel is the wind direction and the slope the two factors that the team can immediately gauge that affect where the fire will move fastest or the wind direction and slope in this case the wind is coming from the north and they know that to the southwest is an upward slope fire moves faster uphill than it does downhill since the fire burns upwards so these smoke jumpers know that this is likely the fires fastest moving front while trees do burn the primary source of fuel that a wildfire uses to move is the dry brush and deadwood on the forest floor so the biggest technique used to stop forest fires is to create whats called a fire line these are essentially a gap where they remove all fuel plants both dead and alive so that theres nothing for the fire to continue burning the smokejumpers use a mix of chainsaws and other hand tools to do this work but sometimes fire lines are prebuilt in this case theres a road at the top of the uphill section which will help slow or stop the fire so they can direct their efforts elsewhere they use the road as their anchor point a cleared section that the fire likely wont cross where they start building their fire lines so the fire cant outflank them throughout this construction process the smokejumpers need to be sure that they can escape in case the wind shift or the fire picks up speed wildfires can move exceptionally fast up to seven miles per hour in forest which is faster than humans are often able to make their way through tens trees in grasslands fires can move up to 14 miles per hour so firefighters have to be extra cautious for this reason firefighters rarely put themselves directly in front of the fires moving front theyll either be far ahead or to the side in the case of this fire as theyre building this first fire line theyre close to a road which acts as an easy exit point but just in case all smoke jumpers carry fire shelters these compact lightweight shelters wont survive direct flames for too long but they do greatly increase a firefighters chance of survival in case they cant escape the path of a fire after a little over an hour of work the smokejumpers completes a continuous fire line from the road to a stream streams while less secure than roads also helps stop or slow down a fire by acting as a fire line to the southeast of the fire theres also a small road that connects to another stream meaning there are at least rudimentary fire lines on three sides of the fire its at this time when backups arrive by road the added manpower allows for much faster action the immediate focus goes to strengthening the southeastern fire line currently just a stream at closest the fire is less than 100 feet from the stream and the stream is itself in a valley so its too risky to work directly behind the stream theres just no good escape route so the new arrivals get to work on a redundant fire line 100 feet behind the stream by 10 am the fire has further grown and the team knows that the worst is still to come fire spreads most rapidly between 10 am and sunset due to the daytime heat and wind by 11 am the fire has reached the road and part of the fire line which means that some of those who are building the fire line are reallocated to make sure that the fire line holds as ding wishing any flames that may jump the road by noon the fire lines are holding and all the fire size is growing its at a manageable pace so theres reasonable hope that it can be suppressed before expanding to an uncontrollable size at 100 pm though conditions change the wind starts blowing harder towards the southwest and as trees burn on the north side of the road the wind pushes embers over the road which ignite underbrush on the other side and now the entire focus of the firefighting effort change you see the point of fighting wildfires is not actually to put them out is to control them while the number of wildfires has increased due to humans theyre actually a very natural phenomenon whats making wildfires worse is humans stopping them many forests survive wildfire through trees having heatresistant bark and other evolutionary adaptations these fire resistant forests relied on having wildfires at a consistent interval every few decades to clear out the forest floor of dead plants and to kill invasive species nowadays though as humans suppress fires a force might only see a wildfire every 50 years instead of 25 for example meaning that theres twice as much fuel and so the fire burns faster larger and more intensely it was only until recent years at the research revealing this was widely accepted so the goals of firefighting shifted from stopping wildfires completely to controlling them in some places being a fire fighter actually means starting fires fire management agencies will conduct controlled burns in order to reduce the risk of an uncontrollable fire and to increase the health of a forest while forests can survive wildfires humans cannot so most agencies will let fires burn in a controlled fashion up until the moment they risk damaging property or threatening human life this fire that jumped the road just did exactly that at the bottom of this slope is a town and the fire is now headed in that direction with no preexisting features to stop it that means that all measures must be taken to aggressively stop the fires expansion to the west that means its time to bring out the big guns its time to attack the fire from above planes and helicopters are some of the most effective tools used to fight wildfires they can quickly and accurately drop huge amounts of water or fireretardant the decision to use aerial firefighting does not come lightly as its both hugely expensive and using an aircraft on one fire means it cant be used on another their use needs to be prioritized for the most dangerous fires theres also a decision to be made on what the aircraft is going to drop water or flame retardant water is cheap and with some aircraft designs can be reloaded near the fire without landing at an airport water is only effective at extinguishing flames though flame retardant on the other hand can be used to stop flames from starting it can essentially create a fire line ahead of the fire spread as it will stop a line of forest from burning the main issues though are that flame retardant can only be loaded at an airport and its a very expensive a gallon of foss check the most commonly used brand of flame retardant costs 3 thats about the same as a gallon of milk at the grocery store but these aircraft use thousands of gallons of it for each drop the worlds largest firefighting aircraft the 747 super tanker for example carries 19 thousand six hundred gallons of flame retardant meaning that what it uses in one drop costs nearly sixty thousand dollars of course theres a reason agencies hire this plane it creates a threemile long fire line almost instantly but it comes at a steep price for this fire using such an expensive tool would be overkill in this case theyll use a helicopter with a bucket attached the bucket is filled with water from a nearby lake and then the helicopter flies over to the fire and drops it with only five miles to the lake the helicopter is able to make a drop about every five to ten minutes and well it works on stopping the spread on one side hand crews work on building a fire line on the other the area that the helicopter extinguishes essentially acts as its own fire line as fire cant burn which already burned this work continues for the next few hours its vital not to let anything to the southwest of the road burn out of control by 400 pm the outbreak is managed and attention can be directed back to the largest section of the fire as the afternoon wears on some crews get back to lengthening the eastern fire line others begin constructing a western fire line and the helicopter works on slowing the advancement to the north by the time the sun begins to set around 8 all sides of the fire have at least some element of control so that during the night and in the coming days the fire can continue to burn in a controlled fashion until theres nothing left to burn this mission was a success but the reality is that this is not a real fire real fires rarely end this well real fires dont act so predictably because real fires cant be predicted real fires are a menace that can grow to the size of small countries and can burn for months during summer and fall there are often more than 100 large forest fires burning around the us at any given time and thousands more around the world no firefighting effort is exactly like another but these are the primary techniques used by those who work every day to protect life and property from one of natures most dangerous phenomenons whether youre fighting forest fires or running a business the tools you use are crucially important in both cases they directly affect how well you do your job and while chainsaws axes and shovels are some of the most important tools in firefighting

__label__1 this is an image of the roman empire at the height of her power in the year 117 ad history was cruel to the empire however and over the centuries she gradually lost power and eventually disappeared altogether but what would a country with the same borders as the old empire look like today in the 21st century what if all of the territory of the roman empire suddenly united tomorrow and recreated the country in a modern form let me start by saying that this is outrageously impossible there is no way that you could possibly convince spain england turkey and syria into the same country crimea would get a little more awkward than it already is too but let us suspend our disbelief for a moment and just imagine what it would actually look like and what living in it would be like so first off this is a modern map and these are what the borders of the roman empire would look like were to come back into existence in total 53 different countries would lose all or some of their territory to the empire which would span over 6 million square kilometers in size this sounds very impressive but the empire would actually only be the seventh largest country in the world by size it would be just bigger than india but it would be smaller than australia and brazil and russia meanwhile would be nearly three times the size of the empire but size isnt necessarily everything if we examine the population of this hypothetical empire it would be roughly seven hundred eleven million people or about ten percent of the total global population the original roman empire in antiquity had ten times fewer citizens at about 70 million people but back then that was 21 of the entire global population the modern empires population would be enough to place it in third place in terms of population size but both india and china would retain higher populations the empire would however have more than double the population of the united states and would boast some very impressive cities if we were to speculate on a hypothetical capital for this empire we would probably come across istanbul which was a historic capital of the empire back when it was known as constantinople today the population of istanbul is sitting around 14 million six hundred thousand people making it by far the largest city in this empire at the height of the city during the actual empire in 500 ad the population was four 50000 but even earlier in 100 ad however the city of rome was the very first city in the world to reach a population of 1 million people even though today rome has a population of well over 2 million there would still be much bigger cities within the borders of the empire today like cairo london baghdad and alexandria at first thought it might seem like such a huge country would be an economic powerhouse and while that would be true it wouldnt be exactly what you think all of this territory combined would give the modern roman empire a gdp of 1599 trillion us dollars which would mean that the empire would only be the worlds second largest economy despite having a population that would be less than half of the modern empires the united states would actually still have a larger gdp at around 18 trillion dollars the differences in per capita income however would be even more shocking the modern roman empire would have territory in wealthier areas like england france and germany but also in more impoverished areas like iraq armenia and libya for this reason the average income of citizens within the empire would be at around 24000 623 and this is a pretty low value the empire would be placed 52nd in the world in terms of how much money the average citizen was earning just ahead of kazakhstan but behind latvia with a large gdp and population however the empire would have a very large standing army averaging all of the active military personnel in the territories within the empire that would mean the empire standing military would be at around two million seven hundred seventyone thousand which would make the roman military the largest standing force in the world currently the final two big questions we have left to examine with this country are one what would be the dominant languages and two what would be the dominant religions to begin the most widely spoken language within the country would certainly be arabic which 32 of the population would be speaking french would be the second most spoken language with about 14 of the population understanding it while turkish would be third at about 95 percent followed by italian in english to collectively form the top five most spoken languages within the modern empire and finally we need to explore what the religious makeup of such a vast country would look like basically muslims would be the largest religious group inside the modern empire making up forty four point six percent of the total population forty two point two percent of that value would be sunni muslims while just two point four percent would be shia muslims interestingly if this would make the modern roman empire the largest muslim country in the world christians would be the second largest group collectively forming thirty nine point three percent of the population of that catholics would comprise twenty five point two percent of the total population while orthodox christians would be eight point two percent and protestants would be five point six percent also interestingly these numbers would mean that the modern roman empire would also be the worlds largest christian nation jews would form only about 1 percent of the total population while atheists agnostics or nonreligious would form 105 of the country its really fascinating to think what a country like this would look like in the modern world and with modern technology and with modern ideas could it possibly ever survive and what would daily life be like living within it these are questions for another time
__label__1 in war theres only one rule win well actually thats not true or at least not true anymore in the aftermath of world war ii 196 nations ratified in whole or with some reservations to additional treaties to the geneva conventions detailing the basic rights of wartime prisoners establishing protections for the wounded and sick and protecting civilians caught on a war zone the conventions also laid down the framework for the international banning of certain weapons of war which well look at today in this episode of the infographic show top ten banned weapons of war war is dirty business and in the aftermath of the first world war the nations of the world moved to limit the scope of its destructive impact horrified by the mass casualties inflicted by chemical gas attacks in 1925 at the initiative of the united states france and poland the league of nations drafted the protocol for the prohibition of the use in war of asphyxiating poisonous or other gases and of bacteriological methods of warfare in essence international law forbade the use of chemical or biological weapons in war since then other weapons have been added to that list all with the intent purpose of limiting human suffering or damage to the earth itself without further ado here are the top 10 banned weapons of war number 10 mustard gas first synthesized in 1822 it wasnt until 1860 that the dangerous properties of mustard gas were documented as a chemical weapon and dubbed the king of the battle gasses mustard gas is surprisingly the least lethal of all the various chemicals that were used in world war one and its estimated that only about one to five percent of the people exposed to it were killed mustard gases real power lay in the terror it could so among enemy troops as well as the incapacitating effect exposure had on unprotected soldiers inhaled into the lungs it could be fatal but while a gas mask would protect from inhalation there was nothing soldiers could do to protect their exposed skin the effects of exposure were not immediate but within hours the skin would begin to blister specifically in moist areas such as the armpits and genitals as the blisters popped they would often become infected which is where after gas became one of the most lethal gas weapons ever used infection typically kills more soldiers in war than actual combat does worst of all exposure created sensitivity and further exposure at even lower doses would cause a reaction number nine chlorine gas another of the gases used extensively in world war one it was first deployed by the germans at ypres on the 22nd of april 1915 though in 1899 treaty had forbidden the use of gas in war the germans sidestepped the wording in the treaty by releasing the guests from canisters not projectiles as outlined in the treaty planning to release the guests from their own lines the germans waited until the wind turned towards the french forces and then let the heavierthanair gas drift across nomans land and sink into the french trenches the attack was successful and 100 french troops were killed chlorine gas irritates the eyes nose lungs and throat and in high enough concentrations can fill the lungs and kill by asphyxiation though seen as a horrific weapon of war the germans argued that the intent was to actually shorten the length of the war and thus limit overall suffering number 8 phosgene gas mustard gas may have been dubbed the king of the battle gases but when it comes to sheer lethality no other gas used in world war 1 to top phosgene colorless and smelling like moldy hay not an uncommon smell in the trenches of europe most troops did not realize they had even been exposed to phosgene until it was too late a slowacting gas victims lungs would fill with fluid and after a day or two would suffocate to death no treatment existed at the time and the best a medic could do is make victims comfortable although the germans were the first to use phosgene it became the weapon of choice for the allies and would ultimately be responsible for 85 of the 12 million casualties of chemical warfare during world war one number 7 nerve gas in 2017 100 people including children were killed in a nerve gas attack in syria by progovernment forces with hundreds left injured an independent investigation later identified the culprit as sarin gas a highly lethal nerve agent banned by international treaty nerve agents are some of the most lethal forms of chemical warfare weapons and work by disrupting the ability for nerves in the body to transmit messages between each other colorless tasteless and odorless the first sign of exposure is uncontrolled drooling from the mouth followed by foaming nausea and stomach cramps follow along with uncontrollable urination and diarrhea eventually the victims lungs become paralyzed leaving them unable to breathe number six plastic landmines landmines have been around for centuries albeit in very crude fashion some of the first ever used were by the chinese during the song dynasty against an assault by the mongols filling castiron cannonballs shells with gunpowder they had an extremely long fuse which had to be lit by hand by brave ambushers just hundreds of feet away from the enemy modern land mines are completely autonomous and can vary in tripping mechanisms from pressuresensitive triggers to trip wires with the advent of the metal detector landmines were designed using plastic in order to avoid detection however they were quickly banned internationally due to the difficulty in locating fragments via xray by treating physicians this would cause prolonged suffering and was ultimately seen as inhumane number 5 biological weapons though around for nearly the entire time that man has waged war against itself biological weapons were only recently banned under international law most biological weapons take the form of weaponized disease agents such as bacteria and viruses but they can also include fungi toxins and rickets a parasites that normally affect arthropods but can be deadly in humans modern conventions dont just protect people from biological weapons but actually prohibit their use against plants and animals as well preventing nations from engineering plagues that can wipe out a nations livestock or crops and thus creating famine which is seen as unnecessary human suffering number four flamethrowers made famous for their use in world war two in vietnam flamethrowers were the answer to combating enemies entrenched inside fortified bunkers or underground tunnels in these confined spaces flamethrowers can actually be more lethal by sucking the oxygen out of the atmosphere than from their actual flames while technically not illegal their use around civilian areas has been banned due to the incredible damage they can inflict on infrastructure and their inability to be properly aimed number three napalm another weapon made famous by the vietnam war napalm was actually developed in 1942 at harvard university as a mixture of a gelling agent and some kind of fuels such as gasoline napalm was originally designed to be used as an incendiary device against buildings but was later primarily used as an antipersonnel weapon as the sticky substance sticks to the skin it produces severe burns and shearing in many of the same characteristics as a flamethrower it can also make it impossible for individuals to breathe though not outlawed for military use its use in civilian population centers is illegal once again due to their propensity for incredible property damage and inability to fully control its effects number two poison bullets early bullets werent very accurate or powerful so militaries around the world would spike them with small amounts of poison or fecal matter while not adding any immediate lethality a poison bullet could deliver toxic compounds deep into the body and result in serious infection that would set in long after a battle took place in modern projectiles the addition of poison would be largely pointless as well as modern bullets are already devastatingly powerful because of the lack of immediate lethality and suffering caused long after our conflict is over poison bullets have long been banned by international law and finally number one dirty bombs nuclear weapons are bad enough and the international community has been unsuccessfully trying to ban them since their inception nuclear weapons are primarily designed to destroy military or civilian targets yet to achieve maximum explosive impact they are detonated high above their target where the pressure wave can spread this has the side effect of causing most of the radiation released to be harmlessly blasted up into space or dispersed over a very wide area limiting its effect a dirty bomb however is a device that is designed primarily to create radiological fallout rather than kill outright with the goal of poisoning land sea and air for a very long time a regular nuclear weapon can be converted into a dirty bomb by simply programming it to detonate at ground level thus creating massive plumes of radioactive debris and irradiating dozens of square miles however other devices such as a cobalt bomb can be detonated high up in the air and produce tremendous amounts of radioactive fallout these dirty or salted bombs have long been banned due to the longlasting and catastrophic damage they do to large swathes of the environment man has waged war since his inception but its only in the last few centuries that weve begun to try and limit the scope of the destruction that we inflict on each other as technology progresses and makes more apocalyptic and destructive weapons available perhaps its a sign of hope that even the most embittered enemies such as the soviet union and the usa have abided by these international laws maybe one day we can even move to outlaw war altogether

interlinked regions and are home to the worlds largest and most influential cities yet laying between them its just one country russia this more or less means that one country controls weather europe can get to asia and vice versa and for a while they couldnt during the cold war almost universally nonsoviet airlines were not allowed to fly over the soviet union this proved a huge barrier to travel in the 1950s flying on boac which later became british airways the fastest route from london to tokyo involved a leaving london at 10 am on friday and stopping in rome beirut bahrain karachi calcutta yangon bangkok and manila before finally arriving in tokyo at 6 am on a sunday all in all that was 36 hours and 10000 miles of travel to get between two cities 6000 miles apart and that was also their fastest service on the comet jet plane their slower and cheaper propeller service would leave london on a sunday and not arrive in tokyo until thursday after 88 hours of travel it was just hugely inefficient but there was a better way over the arctic sas was the first to develop routes over flying the arctic but other airlines soon followed these routes were first used to get to the american west coast faster this involves developing new navigation system to overcome the issue of traditional magnetic compasses not working properly in the high north in the 1950s no commercial airplane had the range to fly to the american west coast nonstop but with sas as new polar route it would take a relatively quick route from koh hagens stopping in kangerlussuaq greenland and winnipeg canada before arriving in los angeles this cut what was previously a 36hour trip down to 22 with sas having proven that commercial flights over the arctic were both safe and commercially viable other airlines quickly followed not only setting up routes to the american west coast but also to the far east the most direct route from london to tokyo flies over siberia but since that airspace was closed airlines chose another way the other way around the world in the 1960s only 40000 people lived in anchorage alaska and alaska had just become a state the year before but its airport emerged as a crucial stopping point between europe and asia boa sees thriceweekly polar route from london to tokyo would leave heathrow at 145 pm arriving anchorage nine and a half hours later stop for an hour to refuel and then fly the remaining seven hours to tokyo all in all it was timetable to take only 17 and a half hours half of what the trip took before it was as drastic reduction in travel time as when concorde cut new york to london flights from six hours to three boac wasnt the only one all the major european carriers set up routes to the far east via anchorage in the 1960s and 70s while anchorage sees only a few dozen daily commercial flights mostly to the continental us today in the 1970s it was served by air france sas klm iberia lufthansa japan airlines korean air and more this tiny town in alaska quickly became one of the most connected and cosmopolitan areas of the world with passengers and flight crews from all around the world stopping over all because of where it was as aircraft became more advanced with longer range there were a few airlines that managed to avoid stopping in anchorage on their way from europe to east asia finnair for example started flying from helsinki to tokyo nonstop in 1983 by flying in international airspace north of russia over the north pole this made what is today a ninehour flight 13 hours it was still faster than stopping in anchorage overwhelmingly though airlines continued to fly through anchorage eventually though the soviet union did of course fall in 1991 and without russia started to grant overflight rights to european and east asian airlines they first had to modernize and anglicize their air traffic control system all international pilots and air traffic controllers worldwide speak english but before since there were few international flights over russia the russian air traffic controllers didnt speak english once the changes were made airlines quickly switched to flying nonstop from europe to asia over siberia that left anchorage largely deserted the airport build a large and modern international terminal in 1982 to handle all the traffic passing through the airport but then less than 10 years later all those airlines that kept the airport busy left in droves today that international terminal built to handle hundreds of flights per month only sees a flight every few days russia meanwhile is prospering thanks to the opening up of its airspace flying to asia over siberia saves airlines huge amounts of time and money so russia therefore charges airlines huge amounts of money to do so exact numbers of area by airline and are kept secret but for each roundtrip flight between europe and asia siberian  flight fees are believed to account for up to 100 of a single passengers ticket price russia has an enormous amount of power by controlling this airspace and they use it to their advantage 133 countries have signed the international civil aviation organization of transit agreement which essentially allows any airline from any country to fly through the signatories airspace but russia however has not so they can pick and choose which countrys airlines get to fly through their airspace the country can and has used its airspace as a geopolitical weapon in 2014 they threatened to shut down their airspace to european union airlines in response to sanctions in 2017 they threatened to close their airspace to dutch airlines in response to a reduction in landing slots for a russian airline at schiphol airport and in april 2018 they tacitly threatened to close their airspace to us airlines in response to us military action in syria but russia not only decides which countries can fly in at airspace it also decides which specific airlines there is more or less a rule that only one airline per european country can over fly russia there are certainly exceptions both british airways and virgin atlantic are londonbased for example but both over fly siberia on their routes to shanghai and hong kong but air france is the only french airline with siberian overflight rights lufthansa is the only german airline with overflight rights iberia is the only spanish airline with overflight rights and so on and so forth for the longest while this wasnt a problem european countries arent that big and few had more than one intercontinental airline but nowadays however thats changing were seeing more and more budget airlines competing with the large established carriers on longhaul routes but with this system of overflight permissions the legacy carriers more or less have a monopoly on east asian routes sas for example operates out of norway denmark and sweden and they have siberian overflight rights that take them to destinations like tokyo beijing and shanghai sas is therefore the only scandinavian airline allowed to overfly siberia but also in scandinavia is norwegian air as one of the largest lowcost airlines in the world norwegian is pioneered longhaul budget flying mainly focusing on flights from major european cities to the us the airline has said though that it wants to expand eastwards they already have flights from copenhagen oslo and stockholm to bangkok and from london to singapore but these destinations are far enough south that they dont involve flying over siberia the airline has repeatedly applied for siberian overflight rights and repeatedly been denied they argue that sas does not operate any flight from norway to asia so they should be granted permission as the only norwegian airline but since sas is partially registered in norway russia isnt granting permission norwegian does have a subsidiary legally registered in the uk but its unlikely that russia would grant overflight rights to this since british airways and virgin atlantic also have overflight rights norwegian airlines also has a subsidiary based in ireland which does not have an airline with siberian overflight rights but sas also has a subsidiary based in the country which could mean that russia will deny rights to this subsidiary too as of now russia has not granted over flight permission to any budget airline others have tried icelandic airlines wow air and icelandair have attempted to negotiate overflight rights but russia views over flights as a way to make money and wants to charge fees that would make it impossible for a lowcost airline for now wow air has planned to star flights from reykjavik to delhi india which in a direct routing would fly over russia but can route around russia by only adding 45 minutes an extra flight time if an arrangement isnt made before flight start in december 2018 russia is a powerful politically savvy country that knows that these overflight rights are a huge negotiation tool pulling the rights of a countrys airline would be a huge financial blow and granting rights is also a huge advantage competition though is good for the consumer and this current system stifles it until russia starts granting overflight rights to budget airlines nonstop flights to asia will stay expensive the fact that this shortcut over siberia is now open at all however saves millions of passengers yearly enormous amounts of time and money watching this 10minute video of our technological progress might make you think that we got here in one giant leap but that of course is not the case we had to develop new navigation systems to work around oldschool compasses build airports tell planes refuel and extend the range of aircraft the problem of advancing enough to be able to fly nonstop to the other side of the world was huge but it was broken down and approached in small steps

__label__1 at sk lts h slash reallife floor 19 malaysia airlines flight 370 was a scheduled flight on march 8th 2014 that was scheduled to leave from kuala lumpur in malaysia at 1235 am and arrived in beijing china at 630 am but flight 370 never arrived in beijing and now over four years later since the plane mysteriously vanished we still dont have an answer for what happened to it or where exactly it currently is the disappearance of the plane midflight and the lack of any conclusive answers has guaranteed that flight 370 remains the greatest mystery in aviation history this video is my attempt to give you as much information as possible and to help explain how exactly a plane can go missing in the 21st century first the basics flight 370 was one of two daily flights operated by malaysia airlines that made flights between kuala lumpur and beijing flight 370 was scheduled to leave kuala lumper on the 8th of march at 1235 am and arrived in beijing at 630 am for a total flight time of five hours and 34 minutes the aircraft that was being flown was a boeing triple7 passenger jet that was carrying enough fuel to remain in the air for 7 hours and 31 minutes more than enough time to make a diversion in the event of an emergency the plane itself was 11 years old and had no previous incidents of mechanical issues reported the flight was operated by a crew of 12 people all of whom were malaysian citizens and two pilots the pilot in command was 53 year olds a hair ahmed shah a longtime employee who had joined malaysia airlines back in 1981 and had over 18000 hours of flight time experience his copilot was 27 year old fariq abdul hameed who had been with a company for seven years and had over 2700 hours of flight experience as well in addition to these two pilots and 10 other crew members there was a total of 227 passengers that were on board 153 chinese citizens 50 malaysians seven indonesians 6 australians 5 indians four french three americans two canadians two iranians two new zealanders two ukrainians one dutch one russian and one taiwanese departing slightly later than scheduled flight 370 took off from the runway at kuala lumper at 1242 am and was soon cleared by air traffic control to climb to 18000 feet in altitude subsequent voice analysis has confirmed that the first officer aboard the flight verbally communicated with airtraffic control before the flight took off and that the captain was in communication with them just after taking off the flight at first continue normally but at 1 of 6 am the plane sent its last automated position report and final transmission the last verbal contact that anybody had with somebody on the flight occurred just moments later at 119 am just 37 minutes after the plane had taken off at that time kuala lumper radar made a call to the cockpit of the flight telling them to switch over to viet nams airspace saying malaysian 370 row contact ho chi minh 1 2 0 decimal 9 good night this was answered by the head pilot captain shaw when he simply said good night malaysian 370 row the plane was now flying over the gulf of thailand on its scheduled path but this is when things start to get weird just three minutes after making their final verbal contact with the outside world at 121 am flight 370 suddenly vanished from the radar screens at both kuala lumper and ho chi minh city this means that the transponder on board the flight was no longer working at this time there were very few clouds in the area with no storms which means its extremely likely that the transponder was manually turned off by somebody instead military radar was still capable of tracking the flight after this point though and heres what happened next for whatever reason the plane began to make a turn right but then took a sudden left turn to a southwesterly direction fly 370 then flew in this direction directly back over the malay peninsula fluctuating a few thousand feet and altitude at 152 am flight 370 was detected to cross just south of penang island and then took another turn to fly across the strait of malacca the last location of mh370 known with certainty was about here over the indian ocean at 222 am which was near the limits of the malaysian military radar despite being lost to radar the flight was still making satellite communications based on an analysis of the satellite data it has been concluded that mh370 then took another bizarre turn in this general direction and area and continue to fly this way for over five hours the whole time this part of the trip was happening the aircraft satellite communication system was responding to our lease status requests from the satellite company immerse at a phone call was made to the cockpit again at 239 am which rang but when unanswered by anybody inside over four hours later at 713 am another phone call was made to the cockpit but this time  it just rang and went unanswered by 724 am while still airborne somewhere over the indian ocean the flight was one hour late past its scheduled arrival in beijing the malaysian government announced that they had lost contact with the plane and that search and rescue operations had been mobilized but unknown to them at the time mh370 was still flying the last piece of data received from the plane happened at 819 am it was a logon request sent by the flight to the company immerse at which would have only happened for a few reasons namely either a power or a software failure the plane at this point had been flying for seven hours and 38 minutes and since it was only scheduled to fly for five and a half hours its most likely that the plane had run out of fuel by this point immerse at sand another status request to the plane at 915 am but this time it finally went unanswered based on that fact its most likely that the plane crashed in the indian ocean sometime between 819 and 915 but its still not known exactly where this happened when the final communication was made with a flight at 819 am its been calculated that the flight was somewhere along this black curve taking that into consideration in the general flight path the plane was taking analyzed from the satellite data and its most likely that the plane went down somewhere around here several thousand kilometers west of australia so to recap the plane departed from kuala lumper on the way to beijing and started flying on the normal flight path but then made a sudden right turn over the gulf of thailand than a sudden left turn and flew across the malay peninsula once past the island of penang the plane took another turn to fly into the indian ocean and then took another turn south at flew for over five hours straight across that ocean before it probably finally ran out of fuel and crashed somewhere west of australia in the middle of nowhere the search for the plane and the 239 people on board began almost immediately the hunt initially began in southeast asia as it was believed early on that the plane probably went down around here but as more information came out about the actual path a flight took the search was changed to the indian ocean between march 18th and april 28th 19  345 sorties by military aircraft searched an area over 46 million square kilometers in size larger than the entire country of india and found nothing a sonar search of the seafloor was also conducted about 1800 kilometers west of perth australia but also didnt find anything nothing at all was actually discovered until over a year after the plane vanished when in july 2015 a piece of wreckage was discovered washed up on the beach of reunion 4000 kilometers west of the main search area the piece was a wing flapper on this part on a plane and was confirmed to have come from mh370 its analysis showed that the landing flaps of the plane were not extended when it crashed which kind of terrifyingly supports the theory that when the plane crashed in the ocean it did so by entering into a vertical dive a few more pieces of wreckage were later discovered across the coast of east africa but by january 17th 2017 nearly three years after the planes disappearance the official search for the flight was suspended after discovering no other evidence for the planes location other than those small amounts of debris the search was conducted mostly by the governments of malaysia australia and china and it had become the most expensive search in aviation history costing 155 million dollars the official report from the search claimed to have narrowed down the location of the crash to a twenty five thousand square kilometer area in the ocean here west of australia an area roughly the same size as macedonia in january 2018 though a private us company called ocean infinity announced that it would resume the search for the plane in that twenty five thousand square kilometre area but as of march 2018 after searching a thirty three thousand square kilometer area around it they too have found nothing after over four years of searching and coming up with few answers the speculation as to what happened to mh370 has been rampant were pretty certain about the path of flight took in the general area of where it crashed but were no closer to understanding why it happened the first major theory that got a lot of early attention was a possible hijacking from passengers on board there were two men aboard the flight who are iranian citizens with stolen passports which raised a considerable amount of suspicion they had only purchased oneway tickets from kuala lumpur to beijing and only entered malaysia a week before the flight depart but interpol later concluded that both men were simply asylum seekers fleeing iran and not terrorists neither of them had the relevant skills to have flown a plane and performed hijacking and both american and malaysian officials extensively reviewed the backgrounds of every single passenger named in the flight manifest and came up with no potential leads there was speculation that the plane could have been hijacked and taken to a remote island but no group to date has ever claimed responsibility for that and following the discovery of the wreckage off the coast of africa this theory has become extremely unlikely a passenger hijacking doesnt seem likely to have taken place but what about a crew hijacking there was considerable suspicion raised around captain sahara ahmed shah but no conclusive evidence has been found that links him to cause a the incident either the malaysian government conducted 170 interviews of friends and family of the crew that were on board but once again nothing significant or sinister was discovered through these if the pilots caused the incident its unclear what exactly would have been their motive for doing so police searched the homes of both pilots and seized the financial records of all 12 crew members the fbi even analyze data from captain shaws home flight simulator but none of this discovered anything sinister but remember when the flight took that turn out over the indian ocean and flew for five hours until it ran out of fuel american intelligence officers believe the most likely explanation for that was that someone in the cockpit of flight 370 manually reprogrammed the aircrafts autopilot before it took that turn and do you also remember back when flight 370 first vanished off the radar screens because a transponder stopped working its also possible that somebody inside the cockpit manually turned the transponder off despite its seeming likely that somebody in the crew was responsible theres still zero conclusive evidence to prove that thats what actually happened theres a few other weird theories out there about what went on ranging from the plane getting sucked into a black hole to getting abducted by aliens theres also a theory that the plane was hijacked remotely by cyber criminals that gained access to the flight controls but boeing has denounced this idea as impossible the final theory i havent discussed yet is the fire sot hypoxia theory its possible that a fire may have started somewhere on board the plane while on route to beijing the theory goes that the i decided to turn back and wanted to attempt an emergency landing at the nearest suitable airport in northern malaysia based on an analysis of the timing of the satellite communications data a power interruption mid flight would be the most likely reason for it its unknown what may have caused a power interruption though since its been ruled out that it was an engine issue it could have been somebody inside manually switching off the aircrafts electrical system but who knows why that would have happened the australian transport safety bureau concluded that an unresponsive crew resulting from a potential cabin decompression event was the most likely explanation for when the plane flew for five hours straight across the indian ocean if this happened then everybody on board the flight would have been unconscious for hours up to when it crashed in the ocean this is all pretty speculative though because a its unknown what might have caused the decompression event happening b its unknown what might have caused the power interruption happening and c even if a fire did happen on board in the crew attempted an emergency landing in malaysia why did they continue to fly over malaysia and then change course out over the indian ocean no matter what theory you might think is most likely every single one has some holes in it to make any of them seem doubtful and if its frustrating for you not knowing any answers imagine how frustrating it must be for the families and friends of the people that were onboard mh370 remains aviations greatest unsolved mystery and as long as we havent discovered the plane we probably wont get any answers or closure its possible that somebody in the world knows exactly what happened to mh370 and its also possible that literally nobody in the world knows what happened but whichever of those two possibilities is real theyre both equally unsettling lessons of any kind are valuable for both societies and for individuals and

__label__1 4k ultra water kaiser law okay how do you decide between 4k and ultra wide why not both introducing the lg 5k ultra wide feat your fiestas historically there have been mostly two different pixel counts for ultra wide monitors 2560 by 1080 which takes your standard 16 by 9 1080p monitor and stretches it by 13 and 34 40 by 1440 which does the same thing to a wqhd monitor both of them have an aspect ratio of 21 by 9 except its not actually 21 by 9 its more like 21 and 13 by 9 so 64 by 27 but i guess that didnt sound as sexy on the marketing materials and also i guess its easier for people to understand 21 by 9 since most people are pretty familiar with how 16 by 9 looks so that means that visualizing 21 by 9 isnt as much of a stretch of the imagination as calling it 7 by 3 would have been anyway none of that is the point all of that stuff pales in comparison to the beast that weve got today this ladies and gentlemen is lgs 34 wk 95 eww i think the wk is for work like working it because this thing boasts over 11 million pixels that are so close to each other that if you tried to pass your body between them you would have to go through one cell at a time it is a lot of pixels and yet lg still doesnt call this resolution 5k they call it 5k to k because they already make a 5k monitor which has 3 million more pixels all in the vertical direction so imho even though there are 5000 horizontal pixels here really this is more like a 4k ultra wide something that weve never seen before and a true 5k ultra wide should have a resolution of something like 68 20 by 2880 but lets not get ahead of ourselves here because 5k 2k is plenty sweet as it is its pixel density of 163 pixels per inch is almost exactly the same as a 27 4k monitor putting it at apple retina levels from a reasonable viewing distance of 21 inches which means you will be blown away by the crazy sharp text assuming that is that your pc can actually drive this many pixels so if youre plugging the monitor into the display port port man i wish they had come up with a different name for that on your 10 series nvidia or rx 400 series or newer amd graphics card then you are golden if youre relying on the hdmi 20 ports then you are basically sol youll be capped at 30 for 40 by 1440 since even though 3840 by 2160 is available you can select it that is a 16 by 9 aspect ratio meaning it is squish ville so say no to hdmi as for if youre using the thunderbolt 3 port probably on your laptop thats where things get really interesting because when we reviewed the lg 5k ultrafine we learned that while it worked perfectly at full resolution with our 2016 macbook we could only get about 4 and a half of those ks on a windows machine the reason was that the available thunderbolt 3 chipsets at that time only supported displayport 12 which doesnt have nearly enough bandwidth for 5k at 60 hertz it only worked on the macbook because apple cleverly used the capacity from the chipsets of two sidebyside ports to push all those pixels through but that changed ostensibly in early 2018 when intel released a new thunderbolt 3 chipset called titan ridge that supports displayport 14 which can handle full 5k at 60 hertz or even 8k at 30 hertz off of a single port so okay thats great linus how do i know if i have a titan ridge good question if you want a one chord solution to connect your laptop to an external display and potentially even charge it at the same time what you need is both a 2018 model laptop that has the new titan ridge thunderbolt 3 implementation you can check with your manufacturer to find that out and a discrete gpu since titan ridge isnt designed to work with intels integrated graphics and even if you have all that theres still no guarantee that it will charge your laptop so if youre a windows user on a one cable laptop docking feature is a big focus for you be sure that youve got a compatible machine or you will be disappointed oh and by the way you can wipe that smug lot a moustache smirk off your faces 2018 macbook users because currently mojave has a bug preventing this monitor from working properly for you  the good news is that once these little details are ironed out this thing will not disappoint its color accuracy is fantastic out of the box we measured color differences that were on average indistinguishable to the human eye despite this not being a 10 bit panel thanks in part to lgs nano cell tech which if youre not familiar works on a similar principle to quantum dot but kind of the opposite so it filters out all the colors except the intended rg and b and its hdr capabilities are what i would describe as not bad now bear in mind that the 34 wk 95 u w only manages a peak brightness of 600 nits while 1000 nits is required imo for a true ok this makes a really big difference hdr experience but at the very least it does sport the new vasive display hdr 600 certification which demands 90 coverage of the dci p3 gamut a threshold that it crosses with ease the biggest deficiency with this panel at least on our particular unit was uniformity though and it was worst along the left edge and in the corners which are a little darker than the rest of the display and you could also make the argument that given the 1500 price tag the looks of the monitor are clean but a little less premium than they could be with that said though personally id rather my money went towards a better panel and backlight solution than fancy casing for the most part anyway so bottom line should you buy this monitor i guess that depends on who you are if youre a gamer youre gonna find this thing pretty hard to drive like especially in triplea titles and i would strongly recommend a higher refresh rate lower resolution alternative but if you specifically want large format and very high resolution the 34 wk 95 eww really is a best of both worlds solution that does a reasonable job of justifying its 1500 price tag so go for it because the rest of the really big computer displays out there are 4k and even though they have a lot of pixels at this kind of size 4k wont be nearly as sharp as this and for my part anyway i prefer the ultra wide aspect ratio its kind of like multi monitor but with no awesome bezels

__label__1 no sport is as logistical challenging as motorsports while equipment matters in any sport in motorsports the human is only half the athlete the vehicle is the other half the performance of a motor sports vehicle is directly tied to having the right components in the right place at the right time so the logistics are part of the competition racing may be a sport but its not all fun and games teams are businesses businesses that are expected to make money the most valuable formula one team scuderia ferrari is worth over 13 billion dollars this means this team is valued at about as much as tech companies discord bird rides or door  the wealthier teams like ferrari are able to spend more money on transport to bring more equipment and spare parts which can make the difference between winning and losing when things go wrong formula one is by many measures the most international sports competition over its 21 yearly races the teams traverse five continents with as little as a week between events a chaotic ballet of trucks boats and planes transports this show across the world each year 10 teams compete in formula one and despite it taking place worldwide it is by all measures a european sport eight of the ten teams are registered in and operate out of europe only the indian and american teams are from elsewhere although the indian team is actually based in the uk while the us team based in north carolina operates a secondary forward base in the uk so that staff doesnt have to travel all the way back to the us between each of the european races which in recent years have been held consecutively with a brief interruption of the canadian grand prix in the middle of the season over summer thanks to this the european leg of the season is compared to the rest relatively easy logistically because within europe you can drive the cost of shipping by truck is so comparatively low to shipping by plane that teams bring whole buildings with them to european races these buildings are what are modestly referred to as motorhomes but can be as large as red bulls threestory structure that includes offices bars and a restaurant with a complete kitchen all of that packs in to a number of trucks and can be assembled in less than two days along with all the other equipment including cars spare parts and electronics convoys of dozens of trucks per team crisscross the continent before each european race typically races are held every two weekends on sunday which gives teams plenty of time to relocate before activity begins on the thursday before the grand prix but from time to time the schedules crunched and races take place two weekends in a row this proves a more daunting logistical challenge as teams only have three full days to break down transport and reassemble their equipment at the new race site even worse for the first time ever the 2018 season saw three weekends with three races in a row on june 24th the french grand prix took place in lucas toilet and the next weekend the austrian one was held in spielberg finishing off the following weekend with the british grand prix in silverstone the austria uk transfer was the most difficult one as it involved driving nearly 1000 miles including through the choke point of the channel tunnel for this track each truck was manned by three drivers so that while one drove the others could sleep in an rv that accompanied the convoy that way the trucks could drive continuously only stopping to refuel but again these races are easy logistically compared to the ones outside of europe the ones known as flyaway races just like with the european races a majority of flyaway races occur with two weeks between them but from time to time races are scheduled on backtoback weekends thousands of miles apart these backtoback flyaway races are the most logistical difficult weeks of the formula one season on sunday april 8th 2018 the bahrain grand prix was held in soccer bahrain than seven days later the following weekend the chinese grand prix was held in shanghai china over 4000 miles separated those two racetracks and yet just like with every race everything came down on sunday night in bahrain and had to be operational by thursday morning in china even worse shanghai is five hours ahead of bahrain which is effectively five hours fewer to do the work but in reality the planning for this transfer began months before around january 2018 three months before the first races of the season each of the ten teams packed up five sets of shipping containers each of these sets held their cicotte carrying things like chairs tables appliances cooking utensils and some elements of their garages they send these bulkier and less expensive pieces of equipment by sea as its massively less expensive than sending them by plane the number of containers per team varies as the wealthier teams like redbull will take more but in general each team takes about three 40foot containers of course ocean shipping is slower but since there are five sets there is always one at the right place at the right time that january shipment sent the first five kits to the first five flyaway races melbourne australia sakura bahrain shanghai china baku azerbaijan and montreal canada then as each race was completed its kit was packed up and sent to the next flyway race destination without a kit the australian won went to singapore the bahraini went to russia the chinese went to japan the azerbaijani went to the united states and the canadian won to mexico and then towards the end of the season when there are no more tracks to send kits to theyre sent back to the teams home bases for the winter at the race track the formula one logistics teams main downtime is actually during the race itself but for the bahrain to china transfer real work began at the thursday before the race thats when each teams logistics manager started making their teardown plan deciding in which order and into which containers their different pieces of equipment should go once that was completed there really was not a lot to do until sunday on sunday morning before the race even started the pack up began many of the spare parts cant be used during the race theyre not going to replace an engine during the grand prix so theyre the first pieces of kits to be packed into their containers not much happened during the race itself but within 15 minutes of it ending the main pack up began the cars the most important pieces of equipment were subjected to a postrace inspection to be sure no illegal modifications were made but everything else was immediately ready for packing all the equipment that the teams wanted at the destination first were put into one of three priority pallets together each teams priority palace filled up the first plane to shanghai as soon as these were packed they were driven directly to the airport only a few hours after the race ended to be prepared for the early morning flight to shanghai as that plane took off the final pallets were being packed up back at the race track holding about six to eight hours after the drop of the checkered flag all pallets were packed up and on their way to the airport by midday monday all six of the boeing 747s used to transport the teams equipment to china were in the air these planes were chartered by formula one but the teams still paid for the space also on monday all the staff started their journey to shanghai many of the lowerlevel staff just flew on normal commercial flights while some of the higher profile drivers flew private between the two countries after nine hours in the air the first plane touched down in shanghai around to early evening local time the freight was unloaded and brought to customs by midnight all the priority freight was on its way to the racetrack overnight logistics workers arranged the different teams freight into their respective paddocks no team is allowed to touch their freight until all the other teams freight has arrived both for fairness purposes and safety to assure that there arent many people around as pallets are being unloaded and moved by tuesday morning its game on for the assembly crews at this point each team had their three priority pallets and their cicotte in their priority pallets teams didnt put the highest value or most important cargo they put the things they needed to assemble first the barebones of their garage that includes the wall paneling the core of their electrical system and the majority of the it and communications equipment by tuesday evening that build was done and the track was once again made inaccessible to the teams as the non priority pallets were delivered overnight early wednesday morning around 6 am the teams arrived back at the track and began work on the final assembly of the garage only after about four hours by late morning all the different teams garages were operational all in all ten foma one team successfully packed up shipped all their equipment 4000 miles and reassembled their paddocks in 58 hours thanks to careful planning and practice workers formula one pulls off this impressive feat every year without a hitch earlier in the video i mentioned how the short seven day spielberg austria to silverstone uk transfer is the hardest race transfer in europe
__label__1 car companies the bus companies and all the other different employers at the airport there are of course plenty of other costs

__label__1 er on the bassy side when youre plugged in in wired mode so when im using them
__label__1 so lenovo reached out to us about making a sponsored video for their new flex 5 lineup of powerful tuned ones like this one these are great for creatives so we thought well hey why not show our actual use case for devices like this here at linus media group so eds all actually just recently upgraded from having just a desktop pc and a pad of paper to having a lenovo twoinone and we figured well since its eds job to be involved with everyone elses job why not do a behindthescenes of how our videos get made so without further ado then i give you a day in the life of editor extraordinaire and professional cat herder ed zl yago music we released a video every single day including weekends and that takes a lot of planning and management because each video has lots of people doing different jobs over a period of several days its my job to know at what stage of the process each video is at at all times and to coordinate everyone so our videos get released on time its not always easy theres construction things breaking people breaking things and topsecret products that have to be announced at exactly the right time the week starts with me telling the writing team how many videos need to be made that we hit our target and not be screwed the next week which can happen if someone goes on vacation or if parts we ordered arrived broken hey you guys think we can do eight videos positivity then all the projects are added to our video tracker spreadsheet which contains all the deadlines and progress info for all our projects we use fancy conditional formatting to make the colors change automagically then the video status is updated and we use the exact same project names here on the server and on the calendar so that every part of the project is easy to find no matter where youre looking this is where i start cracking the whip i harass the writers to update me on their progress so that i can schedule a time for them to sit down with linus for script review the more people we hire the tougher it is to get oneonone time with linus but at the same time these script reviews even though they can take as long as an hour or more have become more important than ever to ensure that even though the linus has written less than 25 percent of our videos this year all our content still maintains a consistent style thick jokes and all as have you in here sometimes i get to eat my lunch sometimes the first major handoff is from the writers to the shooters the people behind the camera i assign one shooter took them to a role thats the footage of the host talking and another shooter to film the broll thats all the other footage you see like shot to the product or silly skits or whatever and next time you see a product appear in five to eight locations consider that it can take up to 45 minutes to wipe the fingerprints off the product set up the two to six lights being used and wrangle up any actors you may need ello hollywood id like one actor please the writers meet with a broll shooter to collaborate on the visuals that will accompany the hosts voiceover by the time this meeting is over nearly the entire script will have what we call with guidance and we call it that because its a suggestion for how it should be done but we dont want to take all the creative freedom away from the folks further down the production chain brandon and max are our regular readers but if were in a hurry sometimes i just grabbed webers available since most of our editors are actually pretty handy behind the camera  hey i need someone to shoot something real quick dennis i know youre not doing anything lets go music next the shooters have to ingest their footage putting it in a specific location on our server for the next people in the assembly line the editors will know where to look for it a lot more went into hooking up our ingest stations than just hooking up an sd card reader were able to ingest footage at 200 to 300 megabytes per second keep your eyes peeled for an upcoming video all about our ingest process and server infrastructure upgrades once all the shots are on the server the editors can get to work putting it all together we use the writers guidance to arrange all the shots and of course add their own flair some of which is subtle and some of which is pretty obvious but its not always smooth sometimes the editors find out that a shot is too short compared to the voiceover or maybe the host misspoke or some shots just wide out missing then well have to find someone available to shoot a pickup so the editor can keep working after taryn pulls an allnighter and uses all 200 of his macro keys finishing up the video its time for quality control the writer sits down with the editor and reviews the video to make sure the information is accurate and that no unreleased products or email addresses accidentally wind up in the background then another editor usually newer tarun reviews it for glitches and then finally assuming we can find them linus reviews it and finally its time for you guessed it our wonderful thumbnails we try to shoot these on the green screen and then use photoshop to make them more how you say clickable before posting them online and thats it music

__label__1 behind any commercial flight is more than a century of political negotiation and a court that dictate who how and where airlines can fly aviation is one of the most unifying industries worldwide because it is what brings the world together the beginning of aviation agreements came with a 1944 chicago convention on international civil aviation this convention established the un oversight agency responsible for civil aviation the international civil aviation organization the icao is recognized by every country worldwide except for alishan stein dominica and tuvalu of those tuvalu is the sole country to have an international airport so that means that all but one sky fairy nation worldwide is part of the icao soon after its inception the icao laid out five fundamental rights of aviation known as the five freedoms of the air which serve as a framework for international aviation agreements each freedom has varying levels of acceptance but every developed country worldwide grants these rights to certain foreign airlines the first freedom of the air is the right to fly over a foreign country without landing pretty much every commercial flight and commercial airline is allowed to do this there are exceptions the eu has a list of hundreds supposedly unsafe airlines that are not allowed in eu airspace but there are no large airlines today restricted from certain airspace it may seem like a given that foreign airlines can over fly countries but the airspace above a country is sovereign territory of that country more or less there isnt actually an internationally recognised line of separation between sovereign airspace and space some say its 19 miles above sea level the highest altitude balloons and airplanes can fly while others say its as high as 99 miles the altitude of the lowest stable orbits around earth the us classifies anyone whos flown 50 miles or higher above earth as an astronaut so that therefore means that the us recognizes 50 miles above earth as the beginning of space however there are instances in which the us hasnt respected sovereignty below two miles when space shuttle missions return to earth they did so much like an airplane with a slow horizontal descent down to a runway their descent paths were so long that they had to descend over foreign nations such as canada below 50 miles altitude and yet the us never requested permission from canada to fly in their airspace just because airlines are allowed to fly over foreign countries doesnt mean that they can do so without restriction of course they need to be in contact with air traffic control but they also need to pay whats known as over flight fees over flight fees are how airlines pay foreign countries they fly over but dont land or take off in for the use of their air traffic control services airlines still have to pay to use air traffic control in countries they land or takeoff in but these fees are paid and calculated in different ways depending on the country over flight fees are nearly universal the us for example charges fifty six dollars and 86 cents per 100 nautical miles you may think that these fees are fairly inconsequential since the only international flights that really fly over the us without landing are flights tofrom or between mexico canada and some caribbean nations however the us is actually responsible for a huge amount of airspace way larger than the us itself it was allocated this airspace by the international civil aviation organization and since it provides air traffic control for this area it also charges over flight fees this does mean weirdly that flights from australia new zealand papua new guinea and other melanesian countries pay over flight fees to the us when flying to northeast asian destinations such as japan korea and china in us oceanic air space however airlines only pay 2163 per 100 nautical miles it may seem like these small charges would have little effect but on longhaul flight over flight fees can really add up especially with the razorthin airline margins that you learned about in my why flying is so expensive video airlines do have to put consideration into where they fly based on over flight fees canadian  flight fees are no tour easily expensive they work on a variable cost structure based on takeoff weight and distance flown so i wont go into actual numbers almost any flight originating in the us has to fly through expensive canadian airspace in route to europe as you learned about in my video about the north atlantic tracks but airlines do have strategies to lower these costs the most efficient route between san francisco and frankfurt goes north through montana up over northeast canada then across greenland iceland and down into europe however airlines dont always use this route on certain days with certain wind and weather conditions theyll fly east through the united states then enter canadian airspace somewhere over minneapolis or chicago so that theyll pay less in canadian over flight fees complicated route planning software takes all the variables wait weather over flight fees etc and figures out which route is most financially efficient even if it wastes time or fuel moving on the second freedom of the air is the right for airlines to land in foreign countries for technical stops essentially that means refueling modern airplanes have ranges of up to 9000 miles so theres a little need anymore for refueling stops but in the past they were crucial for longhaul flights shannon airport in western ireland once received hundreds of flights per day despite being located in an exceptionally rural area the nearest large city to shannon limerick has a population of less than 100000 but geographically shannon airport is the nearest airport to the us so back when airplanes had shorter ranges they make a stop to refuel in shannon before continuing on to their continental european destinations during the era of the soviet union almost no airline had permission to overfly the ussr so airlines had to literally go the other way around the earth nearly every flight between europe and asia was routed with a technical stop in anchorage alaska to refuel obviously this was incredibly inefficient todays direct europe asia flights take between 10 and 12 hours but back when they stopped in anchorage they took as many as 22 hours despite the huge range of airplanes today there are still some flights that require refueling stops australia and new zealand are almost exactly on the opposite side of the world from london so any flight between the two places has to make a stop somewhere on its london sydney flights qantas airlines makes a stop in dubai and on flights between london and auckland air new zealand stops in los angeles it is expected however that within weeks or days of this video going up qantas airlines will announce a new direct route between perth in western australia and london with their 77 900 dreamliners which would be the first direct commercial service in history between europe and australia this 9000 mile trek would take an immense 18 hours to connect the two continents the third freedom of the air is pretty simple its the right to fly commercially from ones own country to another country this is just like air france flying paris to new york or singapore airlines flying singapore to do by almost every international airline is granted this third freedom if the fourth freedom is just the inverse of this the right to fly commercially from another country to ones own there are really no instances where the third and fourth freedoms are granted separately if an airline is allowed to fly somewhere theyre also allowed to fly back with passengers the fifth and final official freedom is the right for an airline to fly passengers between two foreign countries on a flight originating or terminating in their own country now this is very similar to the second freedom and the second freedom and fifth freedoms are often but not always granted together with the second freedom qantas is allowed to stop in dubai to refuel but if theyre granted the fifth freedom qantas is also allowed to pick up new paying passengers in dubai and fly them to london some examples of this freedom include air indias new york london hyderabad route which is allowed to fly passengers between new york and london cathay pacifics hong kong vancouver new york route which is allowed to fly passengers between vancouver and new york and ethiopian airlines anis dublin los angeles flight which is allowed to fly passengers between los angeles and dublin but lets move on to the sixth freedom it may seem a little strange that theres a six freedom in the five freedoms of aviation there are actually nine total freedoms but only the first five are recognized officially in the icao s five freedoms treaty while freedoms six through nine are widely accepted they are not as universal except for number six the sixth freedom is actually unbelievably common its the right for an airline to transport passengers from one foreign country to another via their own country this is just like air france taking passengers from new york to dubai via paris or korean airlines taking passengers from frankfurt to tokyo via seoul as you can tell having six freedom rights is basically a fancy way to say airlines are allowed to connect passengers there are whole airlines that operate almost exclusively using six freedom rights wow airlines in icelandair take passengers from north america to europe via reykjavik and turkish guitar a fiat and emirates airlines take passengers mostly between europe africa and asia via their middle eastern hubs while each of these airlines do have some passengers only taking a direct flight to their hub the vast majority of their traffic is connecting due to their geographic positions between population centers ill finish off by grouping the seventh eighth and ninth freedoms together as youll see theyre quite similar and often come together the seventh freedom allows an airline to fly between two foreign nations without connecting on to its home the eighth freedom is the right for an airline to fly between two cities in one foreign country while continuing on to its own country and the ninth and final freedom is the right for a foreign airline to fly between two points in a foreign country without continuing on to its own country its extremely rare for these freedoms to be granted except for in the european union you see the european union has a single aviation market meaning that any airline registered in an eu country is allowed to fly flights between to and from any airport in the eu budget airlines like ryanair and easyjet thrive on this regulation despite being an irish airline ryanair is allowed to fly routes like edinburgh to london paris to lyon and other domestic routes in foreign countries due to this single aviation market there are almost no other instances where foreign airlines are allowed to fly domestic routes ryanair is also allowed to fly routes between two other you countries like paris to berlin and from other eu countries to outside the eu such as barcelona to fez morocco this is also how norwegian airlines is allowed to fly longhaul from sweden denmark and the uk to the us well more or less you may recall that norway is actually not part of the european union so theyre not part of the eu single aviation market but interestingly norwegian airlines is actually registered in ireland sweden denmark finland and the uk in order to gain access to the eu single aviation market as well as the open skies treaty that allows unlimited and unrestricted flights between the eu and the us theres one really interesting use of these treaties and regulations in the form of short haul flights between the caribbean and the united states norwegian airlines offers flights during the winter months from boston new york and baltimore to martinique and guadeloupe and these arent extensions to their longhaul flights using fifth freedom rights these are standalone flights in small airplanes boston and baltimore dont even have norwegian transatlantic flights normally a flight like this would never be allowed but since martinique is an overseas region and guadeloupe is an overseas territory of france theyre also part of the eu single aviation market and the open skies treaty so those are the five or rather nine freedoms of aviation aviation is a very politically charged and complicated subject but these freedoms do a great job of simplifying and standardizing airline regulations worldwide
__label__0 an open question as to whether the switch to a glass back was worth it but if you wanna protect that glass back lets talk about todays sponsor dbrand you know the drill vinyl
__label__1 there are around fifteen thousand six hundred nuclear weapons scattered across the world but even just one of those could likely obliterate the city that you were living in while watching this video a thought that you may have never come across however is how close are you right now at this moment to one of these apocalypses waiting to happen if you are watching this video right now anywhere south of the equator south america africa or in any of these other countries then congratulations there are no no nuclear weapons inside your country so theres no need to worry too much nuclear weapons much like polar bears are known to only inhabit the northern hemisphere but if instead youre watching this video in any of these countries than there are in fact nuclear weapons somewhere and you individually are likely somewhat close to one of them here is a map of the estimated locations of every nuke in the world and each dot could represent up to thousands of different weapons as you can see most of them are concentrated in the us west europe russia israel to pakistan india border in east asia the lets zoom into the united states to get a much closer look first the united states stores her nuclear weapons in these ten states in these various locations this storage area on the pacific coast for example is only 18 miles away from seattle and this other base is literally located within the city of albuquerque inside new mexico and is home to the kirtland underground munitions maintenance and storage complex that name may not sound familiar but it is actually the single largest concentration of nuclear weapons anywhere in the world the size of the facility is incredible taking up 28000 square meters located entirely underground with the potential to store over 3000 bombs inside or about 19 of all the nuclear weapons in the world many of the weapons inside are waiting to be carefully disarmed and when they are they are taken out of the base taken up the road and onto interstate 40 where they are then driven to a plant here in amarillo texas where the disarmament actually happens so if youve ever driven between amarillo and albuquerque then there is a slight chance that youve cut off a truck driver before who happens to be carrying a nuclear bomb inside moving up a bit to the north is americas armed nuclear response a huge area dotted with nuclear silos ready to fire at the order of the president of the united states there are hundreds of silos scattered across montana wyoming north dakota nebraska and colorado this particular nuclear silo in colorado is the closest one to a major city located only 77 miles north of denver the only other two places in the us where nukes are stored are on this base in missouri located about 55 miles away from kansas city and on this naval base in georgia located just 32 miles north of jacksonville florida thats all of the known nukes on this continent so lets jump over to europe to take a look over here the united states is the only country in the world that stores nuclear weapons in other countries including belgium the netherlands germany italy and turkey these nuclear weapons are stored in these exact locations within those countries and some are very close to major cities like rotterdam venice milan cologne and brussels the united kingdom and france possess nuclear weapons of their own in addition to those by the united states and europe and they store their nuclear weapons very near to glasgow and london in britain and near marseille and central france in the case of france over in the middle east the only known nuclear positions are those of the united states here in adana turkey but israel likely stores their nuclear weapons and positions within the center of their country all within an hour drive of each other and near to jerusalem back up again to europe and russia is in possession of the most nuclear weapons of any country in the world but keeps it a very guarded secret of where exactly they are stored using a best educated guess acquired from publicly available information however and we can estimate that the positions of nuclear weapons within russia are all over the place but concentrated near by several major cities like moscow st petersburg vladivostok and saratov in the case of saratov a city with a population of nearly 1 million people the city is surrounded by a missile division a strategic bomber base and a storage facility together containing over 1000 nuclear warheads or 6 of all the nuclear weapons in the world moving across the continent to asia we can see the estimated placements of the nuclear weapons owned by both pakistan and india and the only other nukes on this continent are owned by the chinese and the north koreans china likely has nukes placed in storage all across the country in these locations and north hariya meanwhile is kind of the wild card when it comes to nuclear weapon locations north korea has detonated five nuclear weapons so far and is believed to be in possession of 15 to 22 nuclear weapons currently its unknown where exactly these weapons are stored inside the country but given that the biggest city and capital of south korea seoul is only 35 miles south of the north korean border it is likely that the north would have at least some nuclear weapons relatively close by what is perhaps the most frightening of all however is the unknown nuclear weapons the bombs that have somehow managed to get lost and where nobody knows of their current location throughout history the united states has confirmed to have somehow lost 11 different nuclear weapons many of these are at the bottom of the ocean like when a plane carrying a new just rolled off an aircraft carrier and into the pacific ocean just 80 miles off the coast of japans riku island chain or the time that a bomber was carrying two nuclear bombs over the mediterranean sea and simply vanished in a storm never to be seen again but then theres the ones that really keep you up at night like the plane that crashed over the state of north carolina that actually dropped two hydrogen bombs over the area neither of them detonated and one of them was found in a tree but the other actually hit the ground and buried itself 50 meters below the surface the government never found it and bought the land around the crash site to prevent people from digging around looking for it in the future another plane crashed somewhere around here over greenland and dropped four hydrogen bombs over the island three of those bombs were found but another one slammed itself into the ice and to this day has never been found the final and most frightening instance of a lost nuke is perhaps the time that a bomber crashed over the state of georgia and jettisoned out its nuclear bomb into the atlantic ocean the bomb landed less than half a mile off the coast of the state and just 12 miles away from the city of savannah which is home to over 100000 people to this day it has never been discovered and if for some reason it were to ever go off then it would probably annihilate the entire city and if all of this isnt enough to keep you up at night then you must also know that russia has potentially lost up to 40 of their own nuclear weapons in addition to those lost by the united states which means that there could be as many as 51 nuclear weapons anywhere in the world that anybody could possibly discover on purpose or by accident and nobody can tell you exactly where they are
__label__1 dubai and end up at any of their dozens of european destinations with one stop its just faster and often cheaper and so
__label__1 this is a look at my morning with the samsung galaxy s nine i wake up 32 time oh my alwayson oled display and hit the snooze button just like i did with my s8 night breakfast and read the news silently appreciating the tall 18 and a half by 9 aspect ratio will select bible with my f sight i grab my keys and jacket and thats bigsby what my schedule for the day oh no no im just kidding about that last one but but but seriously as someone who legitimately loves the galaxy s8 what exactly do the s9 and the s9  apparent carbon copies of the last gen really change and does any of it matter lets find out okay so here are the improvements to the s9 family on paper you get a faster octacore processor of the snapdragon or exynos variety depending on your region some more memory but only on the plus a brighter screen a bump to maximum cellular data rates and a camera with two yes two aperture sizes and then all of this other stuff is basically the same with some of it like thickness appearing to get worse so this means by my calculations here the days of big generational improvements to cell phones these are officially over however unlike a lot of the tech press i am not going to crucify samsung over this the s8 and the s8 plus are a year old now and still competitive with much newer devices like the 5 t from no longer that budget brand oneplus even if the pixel 2 in the iphone 10 have edged them out in dx omar and besides while the improvements are small a lot of them are pretty meaningful so in order of importance to me personally one the audio setup is great and im sure there are discerning audio files out there who take exception to samsungs choice of dac but as far as im concerned the retention of the headphone jack at all and the inclusion of an amplified earphone speaker that gives me stereo sound on the better than ever oled super wide display make the s9 and especially the plus variant the ideal moviewatching phones period second and this is a close second is the camera even if in practical terms the difference between f 15 and f 2 point for physical apertures is less than it sounds like with how wide the main shooters lens is youre not gonna suddenly see like a huge difference in true bokeh pass you know six inches away like you would on a real dslr youre still relying on software selective focus on the s9  dual capture with processing on the s9 plus which is better than this one but it still has issues with that said it is still more than a full stop meaning that at one point five a lot more light hits the sensor physically while at two point four the image should be sharper letting samsung in theory have their cake and eat it too now subjectively the pixel  excels color processing looks more truetolife to me here here here here and well in most situations but this is a characteristic of the samsung camera experience that ive mostly come to accept especially if i get something worthwhile back in exchange and i do this challenging high contrast shot in direct sunlight reveals that one modern phone cameras are getting really good across the board and to that when we do pixel peep the s9 whether you love or hate theyre more aggressive sharpening filter captures more detail and in this shot of my cat sleeping next to me in bed the iphone 10 holds up reasonably well but the pixel  gets curbstomped i mean for some of you this is probably a meaningless edge case but im not a wannabe photographer i just like capturing cute pictures when im spending time with my kids and because i live in rain coover six months out of the year that takes place inside my house a perpetually dim environment thanks to my dark floors so it makes a really big difference to me moving on to the fingerprint sensor location this never really bothered me on the s8 however on the s8 plus and on the node eight next to the camera up there is basically unusable with my small hands so the s9 plus is an enormous improvement then the last big one for me is the structural changes that samsung has made under the hood the new phones are made of more durable aluminum with thicker glass giving them spectacular rigidity other than a d brand skin i prefer no protection and so its comforting to know that my chances of surviving a drop are better but some tradeoffs were made here the increase in weight wont be noticeable to any but the daintiest users but in spite of a thickness jump the battery capacity of both models is unchanged from last year now samsung has been quoted as saying that their eightpoint battery check will give the s9 family 95 of their day one battery life after two years and if that holds true then thats swell or not as it were but as a heavy user the s8 had middling battery life from the getgo once all my stuff was installed so im on the pixel to excel my galaxy s8 something i have installed on it is making the battery drain really fast i havent had the time to deal with it as much as i love the form factor i just couldnt keep using it so my new daily driver its gonna have to be the s9 plus then and thats about it pretty much every other complaint that i have about this phone is either in software or has a simple solution like the bigsby button nothing personal against bixby she can actually do some really cool stuff that it baffles me that google assistant and siri cant do you can actually do much more advanced things like this go to the homescreen boom but the placement of this button directly opposite the lock button was and still is an ergonomic disaster however samsung supports disabling it outright and you can use thirdparty software to remap it now intelligent scan where the phone chooses iris or facial recognition depending on the scenario isnt as consistent as face id but it doesnt have to be because they didnt pull off the fingerprint reader you can just you whatever you want which honestly for me is like okay look here did you know that the ass nine has nine yes nine different ways to take a selfie now most of them are weird gimmicks that i never used and neither will you but i guess thats the samsung experience in a nutshell packed full of features some of which are seemingly random like you guys remember that thing they were doing where the screen would scroll with your eyes and then this years halfbaked inclusion is a crude ripoff of an emojis but but with lots of things that are great panorama selfies so that i can fit all of my friends in the frame awesome faster fingerprint registration with a swipe well it doesnt come up very often but heck yeah landscape boat on the homescreen like a tablet why did that take so long launching two apps in splitscreen from a single button sure why not well okay actually i can think of one reason why not so that you could have your software team spending more time maintaining the latest software on your existing devices instead of creating fluff that no one asked for the s7 is still in the testing phase for android 80 oreo just one year ago that was samsungs flagship phone think about that so the s9 looks solid especially at the unlocked price and the s9 plus gets a straightup recommendation to buy i would take it over the more expensive no date for sure but with the caveat that until samsung makes a real commitment to support at the very least its flagship devices the way that apple does i can only unequivocally recommend them to people who upgrade every couple of years and theyre never going to truly stand out from other android manufacturers until they address this which given the way that theyre catching up in key areas like camera image quality means that time you guys got to be paying attention because the window is closing on finding a new way to differentiate speaking of differentiating ok ok we still have a receipt

homes or at least never have to leave the comfort of the building the answer is yes but lets first take a look at some realworld concepts before venturing into the detailed insanity of all living eating sleeping and breathing in the same building perhaps the most realistic proposal of fitting an entire citys worth of people inside of the same building is the shimizu mega city pyramid which is planned to be built in the bay of tokyo in japan when finished the pyramid is expected to be 14 times taller than the great pyramid of giza in egypt at just over 2 kilometers tall and will be capable of supporting a population of 1 million people who will live inside of it that means that the building could support the entire population of the us state of montana where housed the population of entire large cities like san jose california or cologne germany the building would have eight square kilometers of floor space when finished which is four times larger than the actual country of monaco and even larger than the uk territory of gibraltar however a building this massive cannot actually be built with current construction technology construction is anticipated to begin in the year 2030 and the building is projected to be completed by the year 2110 which is ludicrous if you think about it that is 93 years from now if youre watching this video in 2017 which means that most of us will probably not be alive by the time that this building is finished being built think of all the history that could possibly happen within 93 years and this building still may not even be finished after all of that its not completely unprecedented however this cathedral in the city of york first started being built in the year 1220 in being the first person who laid down the first brick to begin building this cathedral he would have spent his entire lifetime working on the project and so would have his son and his son and his son and his son and so on until two hundred fifty two years later the cathedral was finally finished being built nine generations would have passed from the time that the first person began working on it it wouldnt have been like if your relative from 1765 had begun building something in you today right now just finished it you probably cant even think of any relatives that you may have even had back then and that problem would have been even more severe in the middle ages a distant relative would have begun building a building and their name would have been long forgotten but you centuries later would be still working on and completing what they had originally started anyway its very strange to think about but lets move back to the mega pyramid building in the distant future of 2110 power is generated by solar panels on the buildings trusses transportation is provided by massive accelerating walkways elevators and personal rapid transit tubes with automated shuttlepods that zip from one part of the building to another the building is full of homes offices restaurants stores and is a fully functioning city of 1 million people who live entirely indoors nobody would have to really ever leave but 1 million people isnt all of us so lets envision something like this but on a much larger scale first off lets envision where would be the most strategic location on earth to place a building that could house all 747 8 billion of us my answer is probably brazil and specifically right here the reasoning for this is largely because of water since 12 of all the earths surface fresh water is located in brazil and the second largest dam in the world is located nearby ill get more into the reasoning later so lets assume that weve moved everybodys houses and homes as they are together into one place everybody on earth gets to keep their current sized living space so what would this look like altogether for reference the average us house built in 2013 was 241 square meters in size according to the un however 13 of the world population lives in five square meters or less of living space 28 have between 5 and 9 square meters of space 24 have between 10 and 14 square meters 18 have between 15 and 19 square meters and only 18 percent of the worlds population lives in 20 square meters or greater sized houses so american houses are certainly not the global norm and averaging out all of these numbers gives us a building with 90000 860 square kilometers of living space in a two dimensional view about the size of jordan in the middle east if it was all just one floor but if we constructed the building to be as high as the current tallest residential building in the world at 414 meters or 101 storeys high then the living space of everybody on earth would take up an area of around 900 square kilometers on the surface a little less than the size of the faroe islands in denmark as for food after a lot of research it appears that sweet potatoes are the most calorie intensive crop that you can grow if we utilized efficient farming techniques and made use of vertical farms with artificial sunlight we can construct a one cubic kilometer building that would be dedicated solely to producing sweet potatoes for our population each cubic kilometer mega farm could produce enough sweet potatoes to feed over 27 million people a 1500 calorie per day diet so if we also built 275 of these buildings connected to the main living space than we could feed the entire human race inside a steady diet of pure sweet potatoes since humans need to drink 2 liters of water to survive each day and the nearby dam has a reservoir of 29 cubic kilometres we could have enough drinking water nearby to last us for over 4000 years of course some of the water would be used for other purposes like agriculture but it would still be enough to last for centuries using all of our needs inside the mega building if we kept maximum efficiency and assume that nothing goes wrong finally we need space for other things besides just living in new york city about 75 of the zoning ordinances are for residential property while the remaining 25 is for commercial manufacturing transportation or park space if we kept that same ratio in our mega building then we would add an additional 225 square kilometres worth of building space on the earths surface that would stand as high as the residential portion altogether our mega building that could house all of humanity in the same living space that they live in today complete with all water needs a diet of pure sweet potatoes stores parks and transportation would take up an area of 1339 square kilometers on the earths surface still just a little smaller than the faroe islands in denmark the parts devoted to water storage and agriculture would be one kilometer high and the rest of the building would be 414 meters high in terms of power the nearby dam would provide a lot of it but probably wouldnt be enough to power the entire building it is estimated that a solar panel array the size of spain could provide enough power for the entire worlds energy needs so a grouping of solar panels of this size nearby the building would provide way more than enough since humanity would be using much less energy all concentrated together transportation would be just like in the shimizu megacity pyramid handled by thousands of elevators walkways and automated shuttle pots moving in tunnels inside the building life wouldnt exactly be very nice on a diet of sweet potatoes and never being able to leave the building but in a catastrophic event like a nuclear war global warming or a meteorite impact that could cause living conditions on the outside to become lethal then something similar to this may become necessary the political situation inside would certainly be messy to say the least there would probably be a wealthier section with more living space in a poorer section with less living space it may take centuries and generations to build it and most people would certainly not want to live this lifestyle but still it is technically possible that we could all live in the same amount of space that we do now in an area no larger than these islands in the atlantic ocean

__label__1 okay so this video is the result of two recent events here atlantis media group that have serendipitously collided the first is that our search for a new graphic designer is over the lmg squad has a new member and this person naturally will need a highperformance workstation that they can use to design vector graphics and it videos and potentially create animations and the second is that lg reached out to us to sponsor a video about their new 27 uk 850 monitor its 4k its hdr and it looks like a great match for our new graphic designer so you see where im going with this so we decided to use this monitor in this sponsored video to build a workstation for this guy whose face and name will remain secret because hes not past his probation yet music im really liking the look of this monitor its got the thin bezels that weve come to expect from lg on all sides which enhances the immersion factor its got a 3840 by 2160 4k resolution with 315 a typical brightness and on the back its got a textured white finish and a slim stand with 110 millimeters of hide adjust and 25 degrees of tilt which unfortunately we are not going to be able to see or use once we attach it to our crate case alright so as not necessarily an expert on you know creative workstations ive brought in well i think expert would be a strong word dennis thank you for volunteering wait thats that person no im building this pc for no no surprise so if you guys watched recently dennis did claim in his pc building simulator you know pc building debut that he could build a normal computer just fine it was limitations of the software that held him back i know how to be in real life i know how to do it of course of course so dennis why dont you start us off here with our cpu so were gonna be using a 79 80 excel for several use i know you had you touch it no i know i know we can put it here oh oh okay theres no plastic thing okay yeah thats fine thats fine i feel like this is more like kindergarten class no im the triangle whos it this is trying i know this may be like that okay turn it no no no okay this way okay you put the size of a rice ive seen the video like a big rice bigger eyes yeah thick your eyes like bloated rice yeah cuz this is a big cpu thats what your rice looks like you see long rides i know yeah so you have to open the clip first i know i know i didnt do that in the videos but i know thats not oh thats an ssd no i know that i think that looks different this is the click sound just make a sound effect you know no okay okay stop it im not acting this is really hot out there i dont think youre acting oh no no no this way ha ha ha ha i know it linus dont you i would never laugh at you im laughing with you got it got it got it more accurately im laughing with the viewers they are laughing they are learning how to be a pc with me yeah just like that just like can see building simulator good good collect like uh how much time do we have in here we have we have four rims i dont want to do the math again okay ready now we add our hdr monitor so i can lay that down boop not on any screws hopefully they do that wait wait doesnt fit is this something wait this doesnt go on that side thats okay nice this is like bad oh guys going mm this is c you are wrong i said we were wrong idi say you was right yes seems like such a waste to get rid of a like stand that looks like this for one that yeah compared to this like that but this way we can have the computer clipped onto it okay so youre gonna put it on and were coming through this youre gonna do the honors make sure you got a good angle and casey drops at brennan at the very least we want to capture it on camera im not going to drop this for sure yes this is ian wait its not only the top is on you miss luxx i was kind of it go no you missed out come can you look at it from the side do you see how the hooks go okay oh my god oh my god yes yes yeah your honor wow so believe it or not this workstation is actually more powerful than your editing workstation really yep okay so we are making a couple of compromises we cant especially access the io which is kind of a shame because its got two hdmi one displayport all supporting hdr its got a usb typec with 60 watts of power so you can like run your laptop on the side actually that would be a pretty cool idea just having it plugged in permanently and just having like a wire like velcro here or something that you could run your laptop off it yeah but i mean you lose height adjust and stuff but still one piece full workstation now its time for us to test out the hd arnis we made our own allinone dennis yeah okay lets find out how good it is for productivity then wow its actually better than my editing machines is check out that that realtime 8k footage scrubbing in full at full not bad eh keep playing you can really see my hair thinning at 8k so what were looking at here is a testing code at 4k for upload to youtube and wow that is really darn speedy sorry dennis but this is way better than your machine so were making this for the new designers there his desktop background desktop desktop desk desktop there you go and once he saw this he will know why we need to hire him theres a new desktop get that picture google it its i just have it on my phone what is this what you also have a vessel actually yes and why wow now given this as a workstation its probably not going to come up that often but other than playing back hdr videos hdr gaming is one of the biggest use cases for hdr and you can clearly see that its working in deus ex mankind divided here this benchmark looks noticeably better on an hdr display than it does on an sdr display now with that said in hdr mode sometimes you do run into some odd behavior like for example this thumbnail for austins iphone 10 video which happens to be an hdr video is not hdr so like the thumbnail looks weird but then the video itself is gonna be running in hdr so there you have it overall im really pleased with this nice compact little workstation that we managed to put together it is definitely a little bit on the heavy side but you cant really blame the monitor for that i guess thats why they stopped making cases out of thick steel or cast iron or whatever else the case may be we ended up with really nice cable management and hopefully they really liked it and are especially proud of having a system built by the one and only dennis v ow it worked so its fine i think you will love it

__label__1 okay so obviously our devious plan to back up our entire petabyte server to google drives cheap unlimited tear was going to hit a snag at some point and from talking to wendell over at level one text that point seems to be at about a hundred and fifty terabytes of storage when they start throttling you later so fine then its okay because we had a backup plan anyway why store your data in the cloud when you can store it on tapes music  im wearing mac loading underwear right now to show it to you id have to give myself a pre epic wedgie though like a front wedgie this is the meg store trb 3  hl 8 a thunderbolt 3 equipped tape reader that even in 2018 costs about 10 times more than your mom or dads wife i did back in the 1980s yes my friends this puppy will run you about six thousand dollars for the single deck version or nine thousand for a dually so how on earth does that make any sense lets start this story by backing up a little bit so when i was growing up the way to archive data long term was using optical media so the cd was high on its victory over the cassette in the music industry i think i have a cd around here somewhere oh anyway cds were slow and inconvenient to create assuming that you could afford a cd burner at all but their massive capacity meant that compared to floppy disks oh i have those too compared to floppy disks and even zip disks you could store what felt like an unlimited amount of at least certain types of files because remember that a 144 megabyte floppy  formatting overhead could only store like a handful of even basic things like homework assignments over time though portable hard drives which have come down and cost dramatically over the last decade or two and cloud storage which is undeniably more convenient for small backup jobs have gradually displaced optical media in the booster shots that optical discs have gotten along the way like rewritable capabilities the capacity upgrades that dvd and bluray brought theres just theres just a practical limit to how small you can make the little bumps on these plastic and foil frisbees before the cost to make them just stops making sense but that doesnt mean that the expensive drive cheap media model is dead at all in fact all this time quietly in the background tape storage has been alive and well in the enterprise space with even modern super computers like the sfu cedar installation that we toured last year being equipped with stateoftheart tape libraries this product is a little different though so its the same actual drive that you would find in a data center theyre actually all made by ibm these days and then rebadged so its lto 8 which means that each of your tapes is gonna have a total of 12 terabytes of storage now there is this 30 terabytes on here but that assumes that whatever data youre putting on it is highly compressible so that would not apply to the kind of media that we would be backing up in fact for most things very few people use it so 12 terabytes is really what you can count on and then it also means lto 8 that we are compatible with either these lto 8 tapes or lto 7 normally you would get two generations of backwards compatibility but there was a materials change to barium ferrite that made that impractical this time around alright so why did they put all this work into creating a thunderbolt 3 enclosure for a tape drive well for people like me who have hundreds of terabytes of data but who dont necessarily need lightning fast access to it so what were gonna do is give it a try now when i first set this up i actually did it on a windows machine but quite frankly i wouldnt really recommend that its not a fantastic experience theres this whole annoying rigmarole to get the drivers installed you have to disable driver signature enforcement you got to make some changes in the bios its its a real hassle but once you do get it working assuming that you can find an app that cooperates there are some driver issues on windows as well it is a lot more painless than it used to be now in the old days with tape drives you used to have to take all the files that you wanted to archive wrap them up into another type of file called a dot tar file or a tar ball and then if you wanted to pull anything off of it you had to pull the whole thing off and then you could pick out the one file that you needed now its basically drag and drop so whether youre using finder or windows explorer its a much more seamless experience lets go ahead and load this puppy in doesnt that sound delightfully retro so takes like 30 seconds or so to initialize but were just gonna enjoy those sounds together so the thing about tape is that it has to be read from and written to linearly theres no readwrite head that can jump around on the media and obviously unlike solidstate storage it cant just grab an address and pull the data directly so youre gonna hear a lot of it reeling and unreeling tape whenever you use the thing so this is a piece of software called my lto they have a more advanced version called preroll post that has a bunch of database features but basically what this is you dont strictly speaking needed but what it is is its a piece of software for helping you keep all of your backups organized so in the event that you want to go back and pull like an old news story or something to refer back to it you know exactly where to go which labeled tape to pull and where exactly in the folder structure you would find the files that youre looking for its going to take a couple minutes here to figure out exactly how much data is in this folder on our nas on the vault so this is pulling off a petabyte project so that took about 20 minutes but the bottleneck here is just our network connection to the vault so now we can go ahead and begin so as you get two breaks and files youre gonna hear it kind of rev down but in general were able to do anywhere from about a hundred and fifty to two hundred and small change megabytes per second and thats over the network you can actually do as much as three hundred megabytes per second under ideal conditions so if you like me were thinking initially when you saw this well thunderbolt 340 gigabit per second like is that kind of an overkill interface for this the answer is actually not as much as you might think so were still about fifteen hours left in order to copy about four terabytes of data and i believe it typically quotes this in terms of coffee time theres also a verification process that it has to go through that takes almost as long as the initial copy so to be clear its not like youre gonna be editing video off something like this or anything like that like if you have to grab one file thats on one end of the tape and then one file thats on the other one the whole thing has to spool through like its crazy slow but while there is still a purpose to having quick access to a lot of our footage so its not like the vault is going anywhere so over thunderbolt with a ten gigabit network connection we can easily back up an entire tape over the course of a day and the costs compared to hard drives in store inators start to make a lot of sense once you get over about the 100 to 200 terabyte range add to that that these things are rated at a 30 year shelflife compare that to hard drives whose lubrication will kind of wear out and it seep away causing them to die over time and tape might just be the way forward for us optimas nuforce be free 5 is a true wireless earbuds that doesnt

__label__1 the predator hunter of man and xenomorph alike stalking the most dangerous prey in the galaxy for sport in todays episode of the infographics show we explore you versus the predator could you survive it first its important to know your enemy predators or yahoo juh are a humanoid species with technology far more advanced than our own theirs is a hierarchal society based on merit given out by each individuals specific prowess when it comes to hunting dangerous game for the yuja the more dangerous the prey the greater the sport and the greater the glory predators are bound by a code of honor that dictates their behavior on a hunt they do not hunt the weak the pregnant or those unable to defend themselves to violate this code is to lose all honor and be thrown out of their clan for ever earning the title of bad blood and subject to being exterminated on sight though armed with advanced weaponry predators often prefer to use simple melee weapons on a hunt as they see it far more honourable to face dangerous prey this way rather than rely on technology if overwhelmed or defeated however it is every predators duty to prevent another species from using their technology and thus they will activate a powerful selfdestruct device carried on their person which is equivalent to a miniature nuclear weapon such a death is still seen as honorable in predator society but failing to prevent their technology from falling into the wrong hands is extremely dishonorable a predator who lets this happen is expected to return or destroy that technology at all costs even if that cause is their own life so lets say you were the target of a predator on a hunt what could you expect to go up against and how might you counter it the first consideration is a predators physiology itself on average a predator stands over 7 feet tall and weighs over 300 pounds with the average human standing about 5 foot 7 inches tall and weighing 180 pounds this means very few if any humans could ever hope to match the physical strength of a predator their bodies are also extremely resilient to physical damage on a hunt in new york city a predator received several gunshot wounds from a 44 pistol and had a hand amputated yet survived needing nothing more and some basic first aid although its wounds did force it to terminate its hunt and try to flee the planet so if you were to damage one enough you might not kill it but might force it to run away despite their size predators are also extremely agile and have repeatedly been shown to hunt across roofs and tree tops in fact seeming to prefer using high trees and the like over running on the ground if running from a predator climbing will clearly be a very bad idea a predators vision is also a major consideration if youre being hunted by one predator is evolved to see in the infrared spectrum and yet have a clear preference for hot equatorial climates this hints at predators evolving on a tidally locked planet where one side of the planet was always facing a scorching sun spreading its heat to the permanent dark side facing away from the sun if predators evolved on the nighttime side of the planet it would explain their ability to see in infrared and not normal light as we see our vision would be useless in permanent dark but spotting the body heat of prey against the cold nighttime sky would be much easier this infrared vision is extremely useful in the dark but becomes a serious handicap in full daylight or when ambient temperatures are too high and heat signatures blend into each other to counter this predators developed a bio mask worn by every hunter the mask allows predators to finetune their infrared vision and to also see in different scopes of the ultraviolet spectrum if hunted by one you can use a predators natural vision against it by trying to mask your body heat most famously done by american special forces major allen schaeffer to defeat a predator in the south american jungles mud as in major schafers example is a good insulator but like anything else you applied directly to your body it will quickly warm up and start to give you away space blankets are effective at capturing body heat and might work in a pinch but they too will quickly begin to warm up and be ineffective your best bet is to try to stick to an environment that comes close to matching your body heat such as a sun warmed brick wall or standing under event belching out warm air you can also try to create fires around you so as to confuse a predators vision with multiple chaotic heat sources or in a pinch lighting rubber on fire will create thick smoke filled with rubber particles that very effectively infrared light generally staying put under something thick and insulating will be your best bet but if you must move try to limit your movement to the two thermal crossovers a day just after sunset and just after sunrise changes in ambient temperature during these two time periods will greatly confuse anyone using infrared vision sooner or later though youre likely going to come face to face with your hunter predators prefer close quarter kills and are equipped with a variety of weapons to use at melee or near melee range from hunting spears to ritual knives power fists and even a specialised throne cyber disk if you are in close quarters with a predator your odds of survival are going to drop dramatically however just because a predator chooses to hunt you with a knife and spear doesnt mean you have to defend yourself the same way for close quarters youll want to arm yourself with something that can deliver a lot of stopping power in a very short time take a cue from most military and civilian emergency urban action teams and get your hands on a shotgun the us militarys preferred closequarters weapon from the 1980s till today is the mossberg 590 a 1 a 9 round 12gauge shotgun that is absolutely deadly at close range with forty four rounds proving to doolittle books lower predator a chest full of 12gauge buckshot will likely be enough to give a hunting predator pause especially when a mossberg fast action allows a rate of fire up to one shell a second for a trained operator you can also equip yourself with various types of exotic shotgun rounds such as dragons breath rounds that shower your target with magnesium burning at 4000 degrees fahrenheit the plus side is that not only will you cause major damage to the predator stalking you but youll likely confuse its vision by throwing so much heat into the environment but if you prove to be too dangerous again beware predators have one final weapon at their disposal that is all but indefensible the infamous plasma caster mounted on one or sometimes both shoulders the plasma caster is an independently targeting rapid firing weapon that works by superheating gas and discharging it as plasma capable of blasting through solid steel and concrete walls theres little defense against the predators plasma caster other than trying to disable the device before the predator can use it physically formidable and armed with hightech weaponry predators are nearly unstoppable and if youre ever hunted by one your odds of survival are realistically very small your best bet would be to hole up somewhere and try to mask your body heat until a predator moves on but you could always try trickery by fading to be weak or helpless prey although predators do seem to have some ability to perform visual diagnostics of human physiology the yuja are not unkillable and several humans have proven that they have what it takes to kill one or even multiple predators and survive but to do so is going to require every ounce of willpower skill and physical toughness you have

__label__1 this is kind of neat i have cable managed this case a good dozen or two times before this is actually a case with which i am intimately familiar so im pretty excited about the opportunity to working it again in quite some time now it does have two lists bays here but theyre not exactly the worlds most elegant system this i wont need so were just going to pry this up so this is actually not the correct reading for this piece so were kind of creating our own creds as we go linus has to clean out his entire pc to get started while luke only has three parts to pop in to start overclocking were not sure what the outcome of this will be but we do know it will be close he just isnt cleaning his stuff because he didnt find an advantage rag like i did yes he advantage rags are not real so linus is obviously in a stage of denial at the moment it wasnt real how could i hold it in my hand having already used his advantage drag the linus can be seen here using a box or his underwear where we can try and juryrigged this well we can take this off without damaging it without without too much i think we should go for it i think that were a little bit doing research to see what this trip is trip off see what this board is capable of to hear them whispering as if thatll help i mean the shopping stage is done luke so uh you know the fact that you have crap hardware no amount of keeping it secret is gonna keep it secret forever and then ill tease you oh yeah i forgot about that im sorry excuse i hope this has a right notion okay oh okay so these are a little lot theyre a little worse for the wear right here see there heres a little trick you just give me the old that so here we can all absolutely stuff right there i forgot this i dont have time for his shenanigans at this point in the competition because winners do not consorted own twin as hard i dont consort with them yeah thats right shoot got it in there once therefore i can do it again and that is why i have two children yeah the only one around here with proof of his virility how do you know as your mother would kill you ha ha you can fight no no hes right my mom would kill me youd be dead yeah youd actually be dead yep hmm did you bring out any zip ties no but there might be some in the screw bin thatll do it a hiyah all that is a thing of beauty right there fantastic oh im feeling good today yeah then my mini wheats are like i ate them i crapped them out i ate them again i took a picture put it on instagram this was a real score like this was probably worth a good chunk of the budget right there along just nicely why dont you get the hell out of here spy we dont hate you over here we accept your kind yeah losers are stuck hanging out with the other losers this is real good this is trustworthy thats the difference between this and snakes in the grass like luke oh i should have done this before i did the other thing oh well i dont know if its gonna reach are you missing my epic struggle over here no one yes oh yeah that table management all right all right now we did specifically say that there would be demerit points for leaving the garage and i dont need to leave the garage but i do need to walk over here so im averting my eyes berkel will buerkle will hold this box art aaron is he still here okay well someone someone will buerkle will supervise me here i got saved my blinders yeah okay i got my blinders on doo doo doo doo doo doo doo doo doo doo doo this box right here is called the fun box because theres a chair on top of it for some reason see this is something luke wouldnt even think of needing probably because i wouldnt need eggs im not terrible nice one of these uh yeah uh yeah lets get like a moment there we go alright see you got a system fired up over there i hear keyboard strokes no not at all i didnt finish installing all my drivers like half an hour ago oh whats that sound is that a hard drive oh interesting oh ha i wouldnt know what a hard drive sounds like i mean im all solidstate over here man there we go change to 345 japanse we dont boot fine okay ah heres the moment weve all been waiting for mmmhmm um small problem i mean its not a big problem its just a small one okay oh yes oh yes we got this this is good oh i dont think we have that you dont wonder what we can get out of this baby wow its been a really long time were not gonna quite go for that know that instead of aiming for like ultimate i dont mean for like high want you want to go ultimate yeah well that tells max possible settings in every day that tells me a lot about the other way you waited your system i dont know how much itll show on screen but we can my screen oh wow this takes a while to load i literally didnt even change anything i opened afterburner and typed in a number didnt press enter in the screen with black oh all right this is yeah theres nothing lets me oh come on would you take care you take your attempts oh ill shut her down it looks like i might need to dial back good luck no thats two crashes i wasnt mentioned yet you know you said that like it was a horrible dont worry minded go start yo my computers better under load its like a rotary engine i got to get up to a certain rpm before i do chicken stock i might be blaming you for this and what happened i did nothing whenever i open executables the screen goes black i was working this last night biggest fun i havent touched it unless i came back here in the middle of the night ive been supervise the entire time ive been here all right so this has an fps counter on it i guess were gonna see my score so you might as well check it out oh dad artifacting does that count against me they dont know i dont know i think thats just frankly i cant tell oh no theres some dough okay alright i think i think we have to call this one off okay all right seriously seriously lets just load up three mark here well i think i know something about his system im fairly sure thats a reference cooler that is a sound ive heard before it has a particular tonality to it that doesnt seem its not running in a full happy alright so oh i was your to please hats looking tired were doing fancy damage right again you still have to run the actual games dont be too smug this is a graphics benchmark im just happy i won one of them by like a lot like two times was that cuz i have that backwards and then it goes about two times oh yeah has a crash unless your fps is uh 1600 its just 1920 200 and counting 2600 and counting do you see do you see this clear glitching so were 100 times glitch exploit we dont know im trying to get to 200 times you see in a couple seconds here all right why dont you go ahead and shut that down and ill take a run at this this is the physics test yeah you didnt know there was a physics test inside us so 58 66 is the mark to beat the first successful run im still higher its not as higher still higher the had a hard drive is horrible like everything is kind of working properly i didnt did it start walking though i feel like it started walking because remember yeah it was counting fps with my sinus theres no terrans but look at the science oh its coming back area not nearly as much them i have no im not saying a deduction for all right here we go physics test oh dear so what were you getting here 17 or something oh that is darrell all that lets suppose you know what youre oh now its tired for calling teach again oh ha ha ha 58 66 honey what have you gotten 57 45 oh all right what the hell is this yeah just run it just run it in a bowl and ill go on little situps for thats appropriate whoa average fps 666 minimum forty six point nine six thats a pretty respectable minimum i dont know how bottlenecks are gonna be there im guessing 73 73 youre gonna get you know im gonna guess minimum 58 yeah im not gonna oh oh son son who just got wrecked okay so heres lupes results min 39 average sixty three point three heres minuses results min 56 whoa ever jt two point one all right oh wow ensure swift victory with corsairs highly responsive lightweight gaming mouse the sabre rgb click now to learn more i originally thought you had a 7950 now im pretty sure you have a 7970 which means you spent about half of your budget on your graphics card i think i know for sure you have it wrong i know for sure you have a dualcore cpu because usually because you got absolutely destroyed you must have ddr2 and i think youve got 4 gigs of ram you how did you get it  nah the the thing thats gonna blow your mind though i have a q6600 is right oh words yeah and that that ram and the dual core i think would youll cause a little bit but i dont think you were gonna come out with the core core yeah i got a quiet or what i gotta clubs for so really the big winner the big winner would have been probably a combination of the two they could get a 290 q sixty six hundred eight gigs of ram a good quality power supply an aluminium fronted case if we took my card out of my system and put it in here which is what that would have been yeah that would be a pretty sick machine for three hundred eighty bucks and thats still cheaper than all the consoles we looked at you could still buy one or two games to equal the console price i mean i think for 300 if you can build a rig like this then guys like bear is at the you know its funny and i guess well make this the conclusion for this we get this a lot where people criticize us for focusing really on the highend stuff and and the brands that make the most sense at the highend and they ask us well why is that theres such great value stuff out there on the low end and the answer is that if either of us were going to build a 500 machine do something like this we would do this we wouldnt be buying new that was on exactly i did for the guy whos trying to find one that i can get which shouldnt be that cheap and then i would have not rush purchased that setup because it came with a terrible motherboard because if youre smart and youre a good shopper both of us were doing this at the same time with only 48 hours to turn around all of these deals not even we realistically only had seven or eight hours to contact people and pick up and let go get them yeah we ended up with machines that we could easily resell for more than what we paid and to match this performance buying new from the store would cost at least 50 more or more so there you go guys used hardware good value this was fun but you got rekt i did you got rekt silent that quadcore man quadcore is pretty so thanks for watching guys this has been the very first round of scrapyard wars we have lots of great ideas coming for this series hey you remember how you voted for luke well you should feel bad for being wrong

__label__1 well hello youtube we have a bit of a problem today on this section of the moving but weve been moved in four months moving vlog um something is going on with the server and we havent been able to work on a project for more than like 30 minutes at a time before the server crashes and our computers all freeze and then were all sad because we cant work on them most we do is on the server well i do it im actually doing some writing right now because i cant youd see id love to be working  anything that doesnt see the server we can do now well thats not much but it always seems to go down yeah but the worst when theres nothing else to do youre kidding but you know yolo you only live once lets see lets see the stress that linus is going through its probably gonna crash like while youre doing good how do you fix servers how do you fix it dont tell linus you okay sick thats your goto yeah so heres the situation wanek server over the course of the last couple of days has been spontaneously going offline and turning off in spite of my best efforts to turn it back on and complete the backup that im in the middle of trying to do to our new unread volt while i was standing in front of it i observed one of my raid controllers giving up the ghost so as a reminder this server is running 3 raid 5s striped together in windows of a total of 24 ssds so if one of the raid fives drops out entirely all the data is gone only about 10 of the backup that i was just in the middle of remaking is saved so its time to investigate all right so heres one xserve er so far troubleshooting steps that ive tried you never want to you never want to rebuild something like this if theres a possibility youre going to have to go to a data recovery service because that can make it much much worse so in terms of troubleshooting steps i tried transplanting it into another case so that i could use a different sata backplane that didnt work i tried a different power supply a better power supply that didnt work none of that fixed it and i even went as far as to put in another lsi raid card that i had and try to import the array but while it did detect my drives all of them as unconfigured good and a for an array it was not able to import it so there is some good news there though while im getting firmware errors kicked out by this card right here when i try to boot all the drives are detected by another card so hopefully it didnt write too much garbled data to the array okay so this is basically what ive been doing for the last 14 hours is sending emails contacting different data recovery services theres some that are local theres some that are not local but im not ruling those ones out in fact right now the most likely solution looks like we recover data comm theyve got some some custom tools that theyve created that will allow them to ssh into the system and actually potentially recover the rate the missing raid 5 and then the other two raid fives and assemble them all together and export them as one gigantic pile of data two to one of our servers all without me actually having to send the drives away which would be pretty ideal now obviously an approach like that would not work in the case of physical damage to the drives but because it is only a raid controller issue theyre saying hey theres a shot at this so lets so i downloaded their remote recovery client thing here so right now im waiting for their custom linux based tool to load on a bootable external ssd so that they can ssh into the server im not having a good couple days right now i cant get the utility to detect my my usb drive called tech support them oh bloody hell uh i just figured it out this is linus calling by the way i just realized i have to run the wrd disk image as administrator you think i should put that in the documentation never fails this is why its a good idea to call tech support because the second you call them youll solve the problem on your own alright so in theory we now have a bootable right okay so step one is getting this unnecessary extraneous server out of the way im grabbing a ups to use now in a perfect world i would have a motherboard or an hp a card a host bus adapter card that could allow me to plug in all 24 of the drives for them to do their data recovery magic on but what were going to have to settle for is having eight of them plugged into the motherboard at a time as each raid five is rebuilt raid cards do all kinds of funny funny nonsense and they dont give other software direct access to the drives at a bit level in some cases so we need to remove all these drives and plug them in directly to the motherboard okay now it should boot to that in theory lets just make sure all the drives are detected in the bios and everything oh thats a problem i need to pull up the other raid controllers as well otherwise theyre going to be looking for their drives and i dont have them powered up right now okay oh actually that doesnt look very good pcie for errors what so lets make sure all of our drives are even showing up oh that is extremely worrying oh that is extremely worrying oh thats not good that means potentially three of the drives in a raid five are dead which means this data is not coming back none of it is particularly no none of it none of those but i thought we have none of it will be coming back if we lost three drives from one of the raid fives so lets try moving things around ive never tested the sata ports on this board its possible three of them are dead however extraordinarily unlikely that would be five six okay weve got six now okay that gives some hope im just moving sata ports around i was just gonna say right now im even having difficulty getting this system to post so im im at a whole new level of concern yeah ill let you know ill send an email okay so im at the point now where i dont want to put the drives on this system lets go with this one i didnt like all those pci express errors that the bootable usb was kicking out i dont like that some of these drives arent showing up im starting to wonder if thats what corrupted the lsi card will pain in the ass so thousand things i can think of that i would rather be doing right now okay i got seven right now really yeah wow maybe it was bad pci you line is speaking well i can tell you whats happening so far is i put it on the system that i was running the raid card and the drives in and that baby started spitting out pcie errors all over the place so i got everything pulled out of that system and i have plugged all the drives now into a different test bench and im trying to see cuz i wasnt even getting all the drive showing up two three four five six seven eight okay hey you guys are on the phone for the magic moment where all eight drives are detected by a new motherboard so im beginning to think there may be a motherboard issue that caused the firmware on that lsi controller to corrupt in the first place so im actually pressing enter and i am booting up to your usb and it is loading correctly on this i think that board is dead um okay well thats i dont know if that makes it worse probably does doesnt it you can tell me i can take it that says waiting up to 60 more seconds for network configuration good timing with the follow up call if youd called one minute earlier ive been cursing you for dialing my number so i have to answer my phone because i was in the middle of thinking only five of my drives were being detected you guys know what youre doing right i had a local shop that i was going to physically physically take it to and they basically they were like they kind of freaked out when i said i was having someone use their remote tool they were like well unless these guys really know what theyre doing thats pretty dangerous and i was like okay well ill check with them ill make sure they know what theyre doing so so you guys know what youre doing so basically theyre explaining that theyre going to virtually mount the volumes so were not doing any writing to my disks so even in the event that we cannot recover it by this means that still leaves other options open to us okay there is okay well thats thats very wonderful to hear but im trying not to get too excited right now they sound pretty confident this is like the ultimate roller coaster right now so to put this in the appropriate context for the viewers right now wanek server has several in progress projects stored on it that do not have a backup anywhere else including a fully shot channel superfund that involved a thousand dollars in equipment rental including lots of footage from linus tech tips videos like it is going to be a huge huge devastating loss for us to lose this i mean its got a lot of art our templates for editing editing videos for for scripting templates for employee reviews like all kinds of stuff like this is our main working server know the offsite backup server has not ever been built yet the vault was the backup server if i ever have to like act in a in a video where i have to look for lauren im going to think back to this moment okay so i do need to reboot it once in order to add that 8 terabyte drive so anyway right okay thank you very much gentlemen i hope to speak too with good news race soon uh twelve sata connectors ah ah okay so lets make sure everything is showing up one two three four five six seven eight of those our boot device and our eight terabyte recovery media we are ready to rock okay so within about ten minutes they contact me back they said okay yeah were ready to have all the drives in there so that means we are gonna have to do some jankyass right now so basically what youre looking at here is these drives are going to be powered off this power supply with a jumper these cards and all these drives are going to be powered off of this rig so now we can power all those drives without powering up this motherboard or any of that nonsense okay so we have a grand total of twenty five drives connected to this test bench sixteen of which are running in bays of this enclosure and eight of which are spread out here so there we go theres one of my lsi controllers theres its eight drives theres my other one whoa where are your virtual drives i think i remember a troubleshooting step where i tried swapping all the drives to different bays where i was trying to see if it was the back plane or the cables wow panic moment there but its okay so now we should see two virtual drives here on the screen thats one set show me the second set oh thought we lost another raid5 there mmm okay its good feeling good reality tv aint got nothing on it work show me all the devices to rate adapters one eight terabyte drive one two three four five six seven eight kingston drives boom okay i will let the data recovery specialists know all right so all thats left now then i think i got in touch with them and i asked if we can put a 10 gigabit network card in so we can accelerate the offloading of all of our files so while were waiting for now is for them to reboot the machine and set me up with a network share that i can access and fingers crossed just start pulling off all the footage and while everything else alright so check this out here around here so ive got the instructions for how to access our data so i go into the tritium share and there it is bunch of eulas a bunch of stuff weve got what looks like the file structure lets test it how about one that i that we havent finished releasing yet like something from the the mail a battle over here lets just lets watch it hmm okay exhale it is for sure oh okay here we can copy one of these lets copy one of these clips to my local machine and see if that helps nope oh boy lets have a look i wonder if everythings even here like i dont even see the linus tech tips folder 1  2 are missing these full applications is empty that should be full of things okay well i guess wed better get in touch with them i just got an email back from them please stand by addressing your emails with the engineer its possible the raid definitions were changed from one reboot to the next because of drive letter assignments and the linux 26 was 2065 limit we have i think we have more than 26 devices in there i got another email back  we recreated the block devices please go ahead and check the videos and content that you are looking at again no way oh this is fence im not enjoying this nothing there ill let him know the shares empty this is just like the wildest roller coaster ever i dont even yeah i dont even have anything else to say actually its almost funny i hope to some of you its funny heres the email i got 17 minutes ago i was stuck on a call we got everything remounted so you can now go ahead and do the data once more this is the moment do we not have a  i dont think we ever had a  oh okay um okay so lets go to that channel super fun video that we were looking at yes yes way way justing okay and it was the delivery im getting like tingling okay okay you got to check the source file oh cuz that was what we know was corrupted okay okay okay okay so im transcoded footage xray they did it its back oh my god its back heres another file its back do we have everything in theory yes really holy sh oh i think its finally over that is fantastic hey guys guess what happened with the recovery we got everything back goodness like its just been such a stressful few weeks and that was just such a huge huge thing all of our pitches and proposals and stuff are on that server okay blahniks back bully really everything is back as far as i can tell i have played back video files they are not corrupted blahnik is officially back yeah swegway jousting footage for the melee battle should be fine and well have a better backup scheme in the future i promise that is all yeah shot we should physically print all of our videos every frame i dont think so on my paper youre the good news that want ice pack monicas back gay for hiring other people to do our job i know i dont think its beck but it is its back what are you doing im just letting everyone know that taryn its back the servers back okay so its not always that our sponsors tie so perfectly into our content but today it happened
